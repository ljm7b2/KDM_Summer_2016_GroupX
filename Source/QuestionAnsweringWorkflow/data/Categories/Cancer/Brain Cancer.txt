Brain Cancer
Brain cancer can have a wide variety of symptoms including seizures, sleepiness, confusion, and behavioral changes. Not all brain tumors are cancerous, and benign tumors can result in similar symptoms.

A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain.[1] There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors.[1] Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors.[2] This article deals mainly with tumors that start within the brain. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved.[1] These may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes.[2][3] The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting.[1] More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking and with sensation.[2][4] As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur.[4]

The cause of most brain tumors is unknown.[1] Risk factors that may occasionally be involved include a number of inherited conditions known as neurofibromatosis as well as exposure to the industrial chemical vinyl chloride, the Epstein-Barr virus, and ionizing radiation.[1][2][4] While concern has been raised about mobile phone use, the evidence is not clear.[4] The most common types of primary tumors in adults are: meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas.[2] In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma.[4] Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.[1] This is then often confirmed by a biopsy.[2] Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity.[2]

Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.[2] Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur.[2] Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor.[2] Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention.[2] Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied.[1] Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis.[4] Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes.[4] The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the United States is 33%.[5]

Secondary or metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors,[1] with about half of metastases coming from lung cancer.[1] Primary brain tumors occur in around 250,000 people a year globally, making up less than 2% of cancers.[4] In children younger than 15, brain tumors are second only to acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a cause of cancer.[6] In Australia the average economic cost of a case of brain cancer is $1.9 million, the greatest of any type of cancer.
Signs and symptoms of a brain tumor mainly depend on the size of the tumor and its location. The time of symptom onset depends in many cases on whether the tumor is benign or malignant, and in many cases is also related to the change in the nature of the neoplasm, from slow-growing, late-symptom-onset benign to faster-growing, early-symptom-onset malignant.

Symptoms of both primary and secondary brain tumors can be divided into three main categories:

Symptoms as consequences of increased intracranial pressure (often first noticed): Large tumors or tumors with extensive peritumoral swelling (edema) inevitably lead to elevated intracranial pressure which translates clinically into headaches, vomiting with or without nausea, altered state of consciousness (somnolence, coma), dilation of the pupil on the side of the lesion (anisocoria), papilledema (prominent optic disc at the funduscopic eye examination). However, even small tumors obstructing the passage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can also present such symptoms. Increased intracranial pressure may result in brain herniation (i.e. displacement) of certain parts of the brain, such as the cerebellar tonsils or the temporal uncus, resulting in lethal brainstem compression. In very young children, elevated intracranial pressure may cause an increase in the diameter of the skull and bulging of the fontanelles.
Dysfunction: depending on the tumor location and the damage it may have caused to surrounding brain structures, either through compression or infiltration, focal neurologic symptoms may occur, such as cognitive and behavioral impairment including impaired judgment, memory loss, lack of recognition, spatial orientation disorders, personality or emotional changes, hemiparesis, hypoesthesia, aphasia, ataxia, visual field impairment, impaired sense of smell, impaired hearing, facial paralysis, double vision, dizziness, but more severe symptoms might occur too, such as paralysis on one side of the body hemiplegia or impairment in swallowing. These symptoms are not specific for brain tumors – they may be caused by a large variety of neurologic conditions (e.g. stroke, traumatic brain injury). What counts, however, is the location of the lesion and the functional systems (e.g. motor, sensory, visual, etc.) it affects. A bilateral temporal visual field defect (bitemporal hemianopia—due to compression of the optic chiasm), often associated with endocrine dysfunction—either hypopituitarism or hyperproduction of pituitary hormones and hyperprolactinemia is suggestive of a pituitary tumor.
Irritation: abnormal fatigue, weariness, absences and tremors, but also epileptic seizures.
Primary brain tumors can be either malignant (contain cancer cells) or benign (do not contain cancer cells). A primary brain tumor is a tumor which begins in the brain. If a cancerous tumor which starts elsewhere in the body sends cells which end up growing in the brain, such tumors are then called secondary or metastatic brain tumors. This discussion is focused on primary brain tumors.

A benign brain tumor may be present for some years and be asymptomatic. Others might present ambiguous and intermittent symptoms like headaches and vomiting or weariness and so be mistaken for gastrointestinal disorders. In these cases secondary symptoms need to be looked into.

Cause[edit]
Epidemiological studies are required to determine risk factors.[8] Aside from exposure to vinyl chloride or ionizing radiation, there are no known environmental factors associated with brain tumors. Mutations and deletions of so-called tumor suppressor genes, such as P53, are thought to be the cause of some forms of brain tumor.[9] Inherited conditions, such as Von Hippel–Lindau disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia, and neurofibromatosis type 2 carry a high risk for the development of brain tumors.

Although studies have not shown any link between cell phone or mobile phone radiation and the occurrence of brain tumors,[10] the World Health Organization has classified mobile phone radiation on the IARC scale into Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic.[11]

Pathophysiology[edit]

The main areas of the brain and limbic system.

Brain cancer regions.
Meninges[edit]
Human brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the brain from the skull. This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the dura mater ("hard mother"), arachnoid mater ("spidery mother"), and pia mater ("tender mother"). The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the pia-arachnoid. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space which contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This fluid circulates in the narrow spaces between cells and through the cavities in the brain called ventricles, to nourish, support, and protect the brain tissue. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the blood–brain barrier which protects the brain from toxins that might enter through the blood. Tumors of the meninges are meningiomas and are often benign.

Brain matter[edit]
The brains of humans and other vertebrates are composed of very soft tissue and a gelatin-like texture. Living brain tissue has a pink tint in color on the outside (grey matter), and nearly complete white on the inside (white matter), with subtle variations in color. Three separate brain areas make up most of the brain's volume:

telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres or cerebrum)
mesencephalon (midbrain)
cerebellum
These areas are composed of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glia. These two types are equally numerous in the brain as a whole, although glial cells outnumber neurons roughly 4 to 1 in the cerebral cortex. Glia come in several types, which perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development.

Primary tumors of the glial cells are called gliomas and often are malignant by the time they are diagnosed.

Spinal cord and other tissues[edit]
The pons in the brainstem is a specific region that consists of myelinated axons much like the spinal cord. The thalamus and hypothalamus of the diencephalon also consist of neuron and glial cell tissue with the hypophysis (pituitary gland) and pineal gland (which is glandular tissue) attached at the bottom; tumors of the pituitary and pineal gland are often benign. The medulla oblongata is at the start of the spinal cord and is composed mainly of neuron tissue enveloped in Schwann cells and meninges tissue. The spinal cord is made up of bundles of these axons. Glial cells such as Schwann cells in the periphery or, within the cord itself, oligodendrocytes, wrap themselves around the axon, thus promoting faster transmission of electrical signals and also providing for general maintenance of the environment surrounding the cord, in part by shuttling different compounds around in response to injury or other stimulus.

Diagnosis[edit]

Most of the brain is separated from the blood by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which exerts a restrictive control as to which substances are allowed to pass. Therefore, many tracers that reach tumors in the body very easily would only reach brain tumors once there is a disruption of the BBB. Thus the disruption of the BBB, which can be detected by a MRI and CT, is regarded as the main diagnostic indicator for malignant gliomas, meningiomas, and brain metastases.[12]

Although there is no specific or singular clinical symptom or sign for any brain tumors, the presence of a combination of symptoms and the lack of corresponding clinical indications of infections or other causes can be an indicator to redirect diagnostic investigation towards the possibility of an intracranial neoplasm. Brain tumors have similar characteristics and obstacles when it comes to diagnosis and therapy with tumors located elsewhere in the body. However, they create specific issues that follow closely to the properties of the organ they are in.[12]

The diagnosis will often start by taking a medical history noting medical antecedents, and current symptoms. Clinical and laboratory investigations will serve to exclude infections as the cause of the symptoms. Examinations in this stage may include the eyes, otolaryngological (or ENT) and electrophysiological exams. The use of electroencephalography (EEG) often plays a role in the diagnosis of brain tumors.

Swelling, or obstruction of the passage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain may cause (early) signs of increased intracranial pressure which translates clinically into headaches, vomiting, or an altered state of consciousness, and in children changes to the diameter of the skull and bulging of the fontanelles. More complex symptoms such as endocrine dysfunctions should alarm doctors not to exclude brain tumors.

A bilateral temporal visual field defect (due to compression of the optic chiasm) or dilatation of the pupil, and the occurrence of either slowly evolving or the sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms, such as cognitive and behavioral impairment (including impaired judgment, memory loss, lack of recognition, spatial orientation disorders), personality or emotional changes, hemiparesis, hypoesthesia, aphasia, ataxia, visual field impairment, impaired sense of smell, impaired hearing, facial paralysis, double vision, or more severe symptoms such as tremors, paralysis on one side of the body hemiplegia, or (epileptic) seizures in a patient with a negative history for epilepsy, should raise the possibility of a brain tumor.

Imaging[edit]
Medical imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Early imaging methods—invasive and sometimes dangerous— such as pneumoencephalography and cerebral angiography have been abandoned in favor of non-invasive, high-resolution techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. Neoplasms will often show as differently colored masses (also referred to as processes) in CT or MRI results.

Benign brain tumors often show up as hypodense (darker than brain tissue) mass lesions on CT scans. On MRI, they appear either hypodense or isointense (same intensity as brain tissue) on T1-weighted scans, or hyperintense (brighter than brain tissue) on T2-weighted MRI, although the appearance is variable.
Contrast agent uptake, sometimes in characteristic patterns, can be demonstrated on either CT or MRI scans in most malignant primary and metastatic brain tumors.
Pressure areas where the brain tissue has been compressed by a tumor also appear hyperintense on T2-weighted scans and might indicate the presence a diffuse neoplasm due to an unclear outline. Swelling around the tumor known as peritumoral edema can also show a similar result.
This is because these tumors disrupt the normal functioning of the BBB and lead to an increase in its permeability. However, it is not possible to diagnose high- versus low-grade gliomas based on enhancement pattern alone.

The definitive diagnosis of brain tumor can only be confirmed by histological examination of tumor tissue samples obtained either by means of brain biopsy or open surgery. The histological examination is essential for determining the appropriate treatment and the correct prognosis. This examination, performed by a pathologist, typically has three stages: interoperative examination of fresh tissue, preliminary microscopic examination of prepared tissues, and follow-up examination of prepared tissues after immunohistochemical staining or genetic analysis.

Pathology[edit]

Tumors have characteristics that allow determination of malignacy and how they will evolve, and determining these characteristics will allow the medical team to determine the management plan.

Anaplasia or dedifferentiation: loss of differentiation of cells and of their orientation to one another and blood vessels, a characteristic of anaplastic tumor tissue. Anaplastic cells have lost total control of their normal functions and many have deteriorated cell structures. Anaplastic cells often have abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and many are multinucleated. Additionally, the nuclei of anaplastic cells are usually unnaturally shaped or oversized. Cells can become anaplastic in two ways: neoplastic tumor cells can dedifferentiate to become anaplasias (the dedifferentiation causes the cells to lose all of their normal structure/function), or cancer stem cells can increase in their capacity to multiply (i.e., uncontrollable growth due to failure of differentiation).

Atypia: an indication of abnormality of a cell (which may be indicative for malignancy). Significance of the abnormality is highly dependent on context.

Neoplasia: the (uncontrolled) division of cells. As such, neoplasia is not problematic but its consequences are: the uncontrolled division of cells means that the mass of a neoplasm increases in size, and in a confined space such as the intracranial cavity this quickly becomes problematic because the mass invades the space of the brain pushing it aside, leading to compression of the brain tissue and increased intracranial pressure and destruction of brain parenchyma. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may be attributable to the direct mass effect of the tumor, increased blood volume, or increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, which may in turn have secondary symptoms.

Necrosis: the (premature) death of cells, caused by external factors such as infection, toxin or trauma. Necrotic cells send the wrong chemical signals which prevents phagocytes from disposing of the dead cells, leading to a buildup of dead tissue, cell debris and toxins at or near the site of the necrotic cells[13]

Arterial and venous hypoxia, or the deprivation of adequate oxygen supply to certain areas of the brain, occurs when a tumor makes use of nearby blood vessels for its supply of blood and the neoplasm enters into competition for nutrients with the surrounding brain tissue.

More generally a neoplasm may cause release of metabolic end products (e.g., free radicals, altered electrolytes, neurotransmitters), and release and recruitment of cellular mediators (e.g., cytokines) that disrupt normal parenchymal function.

Classification[edit]
Secondary brain tumors[edit]
Secondary tumors of the brain are metastatic and have invaded the brain from cancers originating in other organs. This means that a cancerous neoplasm has developed in another organ elsewhere in the body and that cancer cells have leaked from that primary tumor and then entered the lymphatic system and blood vessels. They then circulate through the bloodstream, and are deposited in the brain. There, these cells continue growing and dividing, becoming another invasive neoplasm of the primary cancer's tissue. Secondary tumors of the brain are very common in the terminal phases of patients with an incurable metastasized cancer; the most common types of cancers that bring about secondary tumors of the brain are lung cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, kidney cancer, and colon cancer (in decreasing order of frequency).

Secondary brain tumors are more common than primary ones; in the United States there are about 170,000 new cases every year. Secondary brain tumors are the most common cause of tumors in the intracranial cavity. The skull bone structure can also be subject to a neoplasm that by its very nature reduces the volume of the intracranial cavity, and can damage the brain.[14]

By behavior[edit]
Brain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). However, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differs from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body. In cancers elsewhere in the body, three malignant properties differentiate benign tumors from malignant forms of cancer: benign tumors are self-limited and do not invade or metastasize. Characteristics of malignant tumors include:

uncontrolled mitosis (growth by division beyond the normal limits)
anaplasia: the cells in the neoplasm have an obviously different form (in size and shape). Anaplastic cells display marked pleomorphism. The cell nuclei are characteristically extremely hyperchromatic (darkly stained) and enlarged; the nucleus might have the same size as the cytoplasm of the cell (nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio may approach 1:1, instead of the normal 1:4 or 1:6 ratio). Giant cells – considerably larger than their neighbors – may form and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei (syncytia). Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape.
invasion or infiltration (medical literature uses these terms as synonymous equivalents. However, for clarity, the articles that follow adhere to a convention that they mean slightly different things; this convention is not followed outside these articles):
Invasion or invasiveness is the spatial expansion of the tumor through uncontrolled mitosis, in the sense that the neoplasm invades the space occupied by adjacent tissue, thereby pushing the other tissue aside and eventually compressing the tissue. Often these tumors are associated with clearly outlined tumors in imaging.
Infiltration is the behavior of the tumor either to grow (microscopic) tentacles that push into the surrounding tissue (often making the outline of the tumor undefined or diffuse) or to have tumor cells "seeded" into the tissue beyond the circumference of the tumorous mass; this does not mean that an infiltrative tumor does not take up space or does not compress the surrounding tissue as it grows, but an infiltrating neoplasm makes it difficult to say where the tumor ends and the healthy tissue starts.
metastasis (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood).
Of the above malignant characteristics, some elements do not apply to primary neoplasms of the brain:

Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize to other organs; some forms of primary brain tumors can metastasize but will not spread outside the intracranial cavity or the central spinal canal. Due to the BBB, cancerous cells of a primary neoplasm cannot enter the bloodstream and get carried to another location in the body. (Occasional isolated case reports suggest spread of certain brain tumors outside the central nervous system, e.g. bone metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme.[15])
Primary brain tumors generally are invasive (i.e. they will expand spatially and intrude into the space occupied by other brain tissue and compress those brain tissues); however, some of the more malignant primary brain tumors will infiltrate the surrounding tissue.
Of numerous grading systems in use for the classification of tumor of the central nervous system, the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system is commonly used for astrocytoma. Established in 1993 in an effort to eliminate confusion regarding diagnoses, the WHO system established a four-tiered histologic grading guideline for astrocytomas that assigns a grade from 1 to 4, with 1 being the least aggressive and 4 being the most aggressive.

Types[edit]
Tumors can be benign or malignant, can occur in different parts of the brain, and may be primary or secondary. A primary tumor is one that has started in the brain, as opposed to a metastatic tumor, which is something that has spread to the brain from another part of the body.[16] The incidence of metastatic tumors are more prevalent than primary tumors by 4:1.[17] Tumors may or may not be symptomatic: some tumors are discovered because the patient has symptoms, others show up incidentally on an imaging scan, or at an autopsy.

The most common primary brain tumors are:[18]

Gliomas (50.4%)
Meningiomas (20.8%)
Pituitary adenomas (15%)
Nerve sheath tumors (8%)
These common tumors can also be organized according to tissue of origin as shown below:[19][verification needed]

Treatment[edit]
When a brain tumor is diagnosed, a medical team will be formed to assess the treatment options presented by the leading surgeon to the patient and his/her family. Given the location of primary solid neoplasms of the brain in most cases a "do-nothing" option is usually not presented. Neurosurgeons take the time to observe the evolution of the neoplasm before proposing a management plan to the patient and his/her relatives. These various types of treatment are available depending on neoplasm type and location and may be combined to give the best chances of survival:

Surgery: complete or partial resection of the tumor with the objective of removing as many tumor cells as possible.
Radiotherapy: the most commonly used treatment for brain tumors; the tumor is irradiated with beta, x rays or gamma rays.
Chemotherapy: is a treatment option for cancer, however it is not always used to treat brain tumors as the blood-brain barrier can prevent some drugs from reaching the cancerous cells.
A variety of experimental therapies are available through clinical trials.
Survival rates in primary brain tumors depend on the type of tumor, age, functional status of the patient, the extent of surgical tumor removal and other factors specific to each case.[20]

Surgery[edit]
The primary and most desired course of action described in medical literature is surgical removal (resection) via craniotomy. Minimally invasive techniques are becoming the dominant trend in neurosurgical oncology.[21] The prime remediating objective of surgery is to remove as many tumor cells as possible, with complete removal being the best outcome and cytoreduction ("debulking") of the tumor otherwise. In some cases access to the tumor is impossible and impedes or prohibits surgery.

Many meningiomas, with the exception of some tumors located at the skull base, can be successfully removed surgically. Most pituitary adenomas can be removed surgically, often using a minimally invasive approach through the nasal cavity and skull base (trans-nasal, trans-sphenoidal approach). Large pituitary adenomas require a craniotomy (opening of the skull) for their removal. Radiotherapy, including stereotactic approaches, is reserved for inoperable cases.

Several current research studies aim to improve the surgical removal of brain tumors by labeling tumor cells with 5-aminolevulinic acid that causes them to fluoresce.[22] Postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are integral parts of the therapeutic standard for malignant tumors. Radiotherapy may also be administered in cases of "low-grade" gliomas, when a significant tumor burden reduction could not be achieved surgically.

Any person undergoing brain surgery may suffer from epileptic seizures. These can take the form of either absence seizures or tonic-clonic seizures. Medication can lessen and sometimes prevent these attacks.

Multiple metastatic tumors are generally treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy rather than surgery and the prognosis in such cases is determined by the primary tumor, and is generally poor.

Radiation therapy[edit]
The goal of radiation therapy is to kill tumor cells while leaving normal brain tissue unharmed. In standard external beam radiation therapy, multiple treatments of standard-dose "fractions" of radiation are applied to the brain. This process is repeated for a total of 10 to 30 treatments, depending on the type of tumor. This additional treatment provides some patients with improved outcomes and longer survival rates.

Radiosurgery is a treatment method that uses computerized calculations to focus radiation at the site of the tumor while minimizing the radiation dose to the surrounding brain. Radiosurgery may be an adjunct to other treatments, or it may represent the primary treatment technique for some tumors. Forms used include stereotactic radiosurgery, such as Gamma knife, Cyberknife or Novalis Tx radiosurgery.[23][unreliable medical source?]

Radiotherapy may be used following, or in some cases in place of, resection of the tumor. Forms of radiotherapy used for brain cancer include external beam radiation therapy, the most common, and brachytherapy and proton therapy, the last especially used for children.

Radiotherapy is the most common treatment for secondary brain tumors. The amount of radiotherapy depends on the size of the area of the brain affected by cancer. Conventional external beam "whole-brain radiotherapy treatment" (WBRT) or "whole-brain irradiation" may be suggested if there is a risk that other secondary tumors will develop in the future.[24] Stereotactic radiotherapy is usually recommended in cases involving fewer than three small secondary brain tumors.

People who receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for the treatment of metastatic brain tumors have more than twice the risk of developing learning and memory problems than those treated with SRS alone.[25][26]

Chemotherapy[edit]
Patients undergoing chemotherapy are administered drugs designed to kill tumor cells. Although chemotherapy may improve overall survival in patients with the most malignant primary brain tumors, it does so in only about 20 percent of patients. Chemotherapy is often used in young children instead of radiation, as radiation may have negative effects on the developing brain. The decision to prescribe this treatment is based on a patient's overall health, type of tumor, and extent of the cancer. The toxicity and many side effects of the drugs, and the uncertain outcome of chemotherapy in brain tumors puts this treatment further down the line of treatment options with surgery and radiation therapy preferred.

UCLA Neuro-Oncology publishes real-time survival data for patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. They are the only institution in the United States that displays how brain tumor patients are performing on current therapies. They also show a listing of chemotherapy agents used to treat high-grade glioma tumors.[27]

Other[edit]
A shunt may be used to relieve symptoms caused by intracranial pressure, by reducing the build-up of fluid (hydrocephalus) caused by the blockage of the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid.[28]

Prognosis[edit]
The prognosis of brain cancer depends on the type of cancer diagnosed. Medulloblastoma has a good prognosis with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical resection while glioblastoma multiforme has a median survival of only 12 months even with aggressive chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Brainstem gliomas have the poorest prognosis of any form of brain cancer, with most patients dying within one year, even with therapy that typically consists of radiation to the tumor along with corticosteroids. However, one type, focal brainstem gliomas in children, seems open to exceptional prognosis and long-term survival has frequently been reported.[29]

Glioblastoma multiforme[edit]
Main article: Glioblastoma multiforme
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive (grade IV) and most common form of a malignant brain tumor. Even when aggressive multimodality therapy consisting of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgical excision is used, median survival is only 12–17 months. Standard therapy for glioblastoma multiforme consists of maximal surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy between two and four weeks after the surgical procedure to remove the cancer, then by chemotherapy. Most patients with glioblastoma take a corticosteroid, typically dexamethasone, during their illness to relieve symptoms. Experimental treatments include gamma knife radiosurgery,[30] boron neutron capture therapy and gene therapy.[31][32]

Oligodendrogliomas[edit]
Main article: Oligodendroglioma
Oligodendrogliomas are incurable but slowly progressive malignant brain tumors. They can be treated with surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination. For some suspected low-grade (grade II) tumors, only a course of watchful waiting and symptomatic therapy is opted for. These tumors show a high frequency of co-deletions of the p and q arms of chromosome 1 and chromosome 19 respectively (1p19q co-deletion) and have been found to be especially chemosensitive with one report claiming them to be one of the most chemosensitive tumors.[33] A median survival of up to 16.7 years has been reported for grade II oligodendrogliomas.[34]

Epidemiology[edit]
Figures for incidences of cancers of the brain show a significant difference between more- and less-developed countries (the less-developed countries have lower incidences of tumors of the brain),[35]— this could be explained by undiagnosed tumor-related deaths (patients in extreme poor situations do not get diagnosed, simply because they do not have access to the modern diagnostic facilities required to diagnose a brain tumor) and by deaths caused by other poverty-related causes that preempt a patient's life before tumors develop or tumors become life-threatening. Nevertheless, studies[which?] suggest that certain forms of primary brain tumors are more prevalent among certain groups of the population.

The incidence of low-grade astrocytoma has not been shown to vary significantly with nationality. However, studies examining the incidence of malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors have shown some variation with national origin. Since some high-grade lesions arise from low-grade tumors, these trends are worth mentioning. Specifically, the incidence of CNS tumors in the United States, Israel, and the Nordic countries is relatively high, while Japan and Asian countries have a lower incidence. These differences probably reflect some biological differences as well as differences in pathologic diagnosis and reporting.[36] Worldwide data on incidence of cancer can be found at the WHO (World Health Organisation) and is handled by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) located in France.[37]

United States[edit]
For the United States in the year 2005, it was projected that there would be 43,800 new cases of brain tumors [38][39] which accounted for less than 1 percent of all cancers, 2.4 percent of all cancer deaths,[40] and 20–25 percent of pediatric cancers.[40][41] Ultimately, it is estimated there are 13,000 deaths per year in the United States alone as a result of brain tumors.[39]

UK[edit]
Brain, other CNS or intracranial tumors are the ninth most common cancer in the UK (around 10,600 people were diagnosed in 2013), and it is the eighth most common cause of cancer death (around 5,200 people died in 2012).[42]

Research[edit]
Immunotherapy[edit]
Cancer immunotherapy is being actively studied. For malignant gliomas no therapy has been shown to improve life expectancy as of 2015.[43]

Vesicular stomatitis virus[edit]
See also: Oncolytic virus
In 2000, researchers used the vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV, to infect and kill cancer cells without affecting healthy cells.[44][45]

The initial discovery of the virus' oncolytic properties were limited to only a few types of cancer. Several independent studies have identified many more types susceptible to the virus, including glioblastoma multiforme cancer cells, which account for the majority of brain tumors.

In 2008, researchers artificially engineered strains of VSV that were less cytotoxic to normal cells. This advance allows administration of the virus without coadministration with interferon. Consequently, administration of the virus can be given intravenously or through the olfactory nerve. In the research, a human brain tumor was implanted into mice brains.

Research on virus treatment like this has been conducted for some years, but no other viruses have been shown to be as efficient or specific as the VSV mutant strains.

Retroviral replicating vectors[edit]

Led by Prof. Nori Kasahara, researchers from USC, who are now at UCLA, reported in 2001 the first successful example of applying the use of retroviral replicating vectors towards transducing cell lines derived from solid tumors.[46] Building on this initial work, the researchers applied the technology to in vivo models of cancer and in 2005 reported a long-term survival benefit in an experimental brain tumor animal model.[47][unreliable medical source?] Subsequently, in preparation for human clinical trials, this technology was further developed by Tocagen (a pharmaceutical company primarily focused on brain cancer treatments) as a combination treatment (Toca 511 & Toca FC). This has been under investigation since 2010 in a Phase I/II clinical trial for the potential treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma. No results have yet been published.[48]

Last update: PMID 23436013 (July 2014)
In the USA, about 2,000 children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age are diagnosed with malignant brain tumors each year. Higher incidence rates were reported in 1985–1994 than in 1975–1983. There is some debate as to the reasons; one theory is that the trend is the result of improved diagnosis and reporting, since the jump occurred at the same time that MRIs became available widely, and there was no coincident jump in mortality. The central nervous system cancer survival rate in children is approximately 60%. The rate varies with the type of cancer and the age of onset: younger patients have higher mortality.[49]

In children under 2, about 70% of brain tumors are medulloblastomas, ependymomas, and low-grade gliomas. Less commonly, and seen usually in infants, are teratomas and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors.[50] Germ cell tumors, including teratomas, make up just 3% of pediatric primary brain tumors, but the worldwide incidence varies significantly.[51]

In the UK, 429 children aged 14 and under are diagnosed with a brain tumour on average each year, and 563 children and young people under the age of 19 are diagnosed.
Signs and symptoms of a brain tumor mainly depend on the size of the tumor and its location. The time of symptom onset depends in many cases on whether the tumor is benign or malignant, and in many cases is also related to the change in the nature of the neoplasm, from slow-growing, late-symptom-onset benign to faster-growing, early-symptom-onset malignant.

Symptoms of both primary and secondary brain tumors can be divided into three main categories:

Symptoms as consequences of increased intracranial pressure (often first noticed): Large tumors or tumors with extensive peritumoral swelling (edema) inevitably lead to elevated intracranial pressure which translates clinically into headaches, vomiting with or without nausea, altered state of consciousness (somnolence, coma), dilation of the pupil on the side of the lesion (anisocoria), papilledema (prominent optic disc at the funduscopic eye examination). However, even small tumors obstructing the passage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can also present such symptoms. Increased intracranial pressure may result in brain herniation (i.e. displacement) of certain parts of the brain, such as the cerebellar tonsils or the temporal uncus, resulting in lethal brainstem compression. In very young children, elevated intracranial pressure may cause an increase in the diameter of the skull and bulging of the fontanelles.
Dysfunction: depending on the tumor location and the damage it may have caused to surrounding brain structures, either through compression or infiltration, focal neurologic symptoms may occur, such as cognitive and behavioral impairment including impaired judgment, memory loss, lack of recognition, spatial orientation disorders, personality or emotional changes, hemiparesis, hypoesthesia, aphasia, ataxia, visual field impairment, impaired sense of smell, impaired hearing, facial paralysis, double vision, dizziness, but more severe symptoms might occur too, such as paralysis on one side of the body hemiplegia or impairment in swallowing. These symptoms are not specific for brain tumors – they may be caused by a large variety of neurologic conditions (e.g. stroke, traumatic brain injury). What counts, however, is the location of the lesion and the functional systems (e.g. motor, sensory, visual, etc.) it affects. A bilateral temporal visual field defect (bitemporal hemianopia—due to compression of the optic chiasm), often associated with endocrine dysfunction—either hypopituitarism or hyperproduction of pituitary hormones and hyperprolactinemia is suggestive of a pituitary tumor.
Irritation: abnormal fatigue, weariness, absences and tremors, but also epileptic seizures.
Primary brain tumors can be either malignant (contain cancer cells) or benign (do not contain cancer cells). A primary brain tumor is a tumor which begins in the brain. If a cancerous tumor which starts elsewhere in the body sends cells which end up growing in the brain, such tumors are then called secondary or metastatic brain tumors. This discussion is focused on primary brain tumors.

A benign brain tumor may be present for some years and be asymptomatic. Others might present ambiguous and intermittent symptoms like headaches and vomiting or weariness and so be mistaken for gastrointestinal disorders. In these cases secondary symptoms need to be looked into.

Cause[edit]
Epidemiological studies are required to determine risk factors.[8] Aside from exposure to vinyl chloride or ionizing radiation, there are no known environmental factors associated with brain tumors. Mutations and deletions of so-called tumor suppressor genes, such as P53, are thought to be the cause of some forms of brain tumor.[9] Inherited conditions, such as Von Hippel–Lindau disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia, and neurofibromatosis type 2 carry a high risk for the development of brain tumors.

Although studies have not shown any link between cell phone or mobile phone radiation and the occurrence of brain tumors,[10] the World Health Organization has classified mobile phone radiation on the IARC scale into Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic.[11]

Pathophysiology[edit]

The main areas of the brain and limbic system.

Brain cancer regions.
Meninges[edit]
Human brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the brain from the skull. This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the dura mater ("hard mother"), arachnoid mater ("spidery mother"), and pia mater ("tender mother"). The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the pia-arachnoid. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space which contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This fluid circulates in the narrow spaces between cells and through the cavities in the brain called ventricles, to nourish, support, and protect the brain tissue. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the blood–brain barrier which protects the brain from toxins that might enter through the blood. Tumors of the meninges are meningiomas and are often benign.

Brain matter[edit]
The brains of humans and other vertebrates are composed of very soft tissue and a gelatin-like texture. Living brain tissue has a pink tint in color on the outside (grey matter), and nearly complete white on the inside (white matter), with subtle variations in color. Three separate brain areas make up most of the brain's volume:

telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres or cerebrum)
mesencephalon (midbrain)
cerebellum
These areas are composed of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glia. These two types are equally numerous in the brain as a whole, although glial cells outnumber neurons roughly 4 to 1 in the cerebral cortex. Glia come in several types, which perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development.

Primary tumors of the glial cells are called gliomas and often are malignant by the time they are diagnosed.

Spinal cord and other tissues[edit]
The pons in the brainstem is a specific region that consists of myelinated axons much like the spinal cord. The thalamus and hypothalamus of the diencephalon also consist of neuron and glial cell tissue with the hypophysis (pituitary gland) and pineal gland (which is glandular tissue) attached at the bottom; tumors of the pituitary and pineal gland are often benign. The medulla oblongata is at the start of the spinal cord and is composed mainly of neuron tissue enveloped in Schwann cells and meninges tissue. The spinal cord is made up of bundles of these axons. Glial cells such as Schwann cells in the periphery or, within the cord itself, oligodendrocytes, wrap themselves around the axon, thus promoting faster transmission of electrical signals and also providing for general maintenance of the environment surrounding the cord, in part by shuttling different compounds around in response to injury or other stimulus.

Diagnosis[edit]

A posterior fossa tumor leading to mass effect and midline shift
Most of the brain is separated from the blood by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which exerts a restrictive control as to which substances are allowed to pass. Therefore, many tracers that reach tumors in the body very easily would only reach brain tumors once there is a disruption of the BBB. Thus the disruption of the BBB, which can be detected by a MRI and CT, is regarded as the main diagnostic indicator for malignant gliomas, meningiomas, and brain metastases.[12]

Although there is no specific or singular clinical symptom or sign for any brain tumors, the presence of a combination of symptoms and the lack of corresponding clinical indications of infections or other causes can be an indicator to redirect diagnostic investigation towards the possibility of an intracranial neoplasm. Brain tumors have similar characteristics and obstacles when it comes to diagnosis and therapy with tumors located elsewhere in the body. However, they create specific issues that follow closely to the properties of the organ they are in.[12]

The diagnosis will often start by taking a medical history noting medical antecedents, and current symptoms. Clinical and laboratory investigations will serve to exclude infections as the cause of the symptoms. Examinations in this stage may include the eyes, otolaryngological (or ENT) and electrophysiological exams. The use of electroencephalography (EEG) often plays a role in the diagnosis of brain tumors.

Swelling, or obstruction of the passage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain may cause (early) signs of increased intracranial pressure which translates clinically into headaches, vomiting, or an altered state of consciousness, and in children changes to the diameter of the skull and bulging of the fontanelles. More complex symptoms such as endocrine dysfunctions should alarm doctors not to exclude brain tumors.

A bilateral temporal visual field defect (due to compression of the optic chiasm) or dilatation of the pupil, and the occurrence of either slowly evolving or the sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms, such as cognitive and behavioral impairment (including impaired judgment, memory loss, lack of recognition, spatial orientation disorders), personality or emotional changes, hemiparesis, hypoesthesia, aphasia, ataxia, visual field impairment, impaired sense of smell, impaired hearing, facial paralysis, double vision, or more severe symptoms such as tremors, paralysis on one side of the body hemiplegia, or (epileptic) seizures in a patient with a negative history for epilepsy, should raise the possibility of a brain tumor.

Imaging[edit]
Medical imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Early imaging methods—invasive and sometimes dangerous— such as pneumoencephalography and cerebral angiography have been abandoned in favor of non-invasive, high-resolution techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. Neoplasms will often show as differently colored masses (also referred to as processes) in CT or MRI results.

Benign brain tumors often show up as hypodense (darker than brain tissue) mass lesions on CT scans. On MRI, they appear either hypodense or isointense (same intensity as brain tissue) on T1-weighted scans, or hyperintense (brighter than brain tissue) on T2-weighted MRI, although the appearance is variable.
Contrast agent uptake, sometimes in characteristic patterns, can be demonstrated on either CT or MRI scans in most malignant primary and metastatic brain tumors.
Pressure areas where the brain tissue has been compressed by a tumor also appear hyperintense on T2-weighted scans and might indicate the presence a diffuse neoplasm due to an unclear outline. Swelling around the tumor known as peritumoral edema can also show a similar result.
This is because these tumors disrupt the normal functioning of the BBB and lead to an increase in its permeability. However, it is not possible to diagnose high- versus low-grade gliomas based on enhancement pattern alone.

The definitive diagnosis of brain tumor can only be confirmed by histological examination of tumor tissue samples obtained either by means of brain biopsy or open surgery. The histological examination is essential for determining the appropriate treatment and the correct prognosis. This examination, performed by a pathologist, typically has three stages: interoperative examination of fresh tissue, preliminary microscopic examination of prepared tissues, and follow-up examination of prepared tissues after immunohistochemical staining or genetic analysis.

Pathology[edit]

Tumors have characteristics that allow determination of malignacy and how they will evolve, and determining these characteristics will allow the medical team to determine the management plan.

Anaplasia or dedifferentiation: loss of differentiation of cells and of their orientation to one another and blood vessels, a characteristic of anaplastic tumor tissue. Anaplastic cells have lost total control of their normal functions and many have deteriorated cell structures. Anaplastic cells often have abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and many are multinucleated. Additionally, the nuclei of anaplastic cells are usually unnaturally shaped or oversized. Cells can become anaplastic in two ways: neoplastic tumor cells can dedifferentiate to become anaplasias (the dedifferentiation causes the cells to lose all of their normal structure/function), or cancer stem cells can increase in their capacity to multiply (i.e., uncontrollable growth due to failure of differentiation).

Atypia: an indication of abnormality of a cell (which may be indicative for malignancy). Significance of the abnormality is highly dependent on context.

Neoplasia: the (uncontrolled) division of cells. As such, neoplasia is not problematic but its consequences are: the uncontrolled division of cells means that the mass of a neoplasm increases in size, and in a confined space such as the intracranial cavity this quickly becomes problematic because the mass invades the space of the brain pushing it aside, leading to compression of the brain tissue and increased intracranial pressure and destruction of brain parenchyma. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may be attributable to the direct mass effect of the tumor, increased blood volume, or increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, which may in turn have secondary symptoms.

Necrosis: the (premature) death of cells, caused by external factors such as infection, toxin or trauma. Necrotic cells send the wrong chemical signals which prevents phagocytes from disposing of the dead cells, leading to a buildup of dead tissue, cell debris and toxins at or near the site of the necrotic cells[13]

Arterial and venous hypoxia, or the deprivation of adequate oxygen supply to certain areas of the brain, occurs when a tumor makes use of nearby blood vessels for its supply of blood and the neoplasm enters into competition for nutrients with the surrounding brain tissue.

More generally a neoplasm may cause release of metabolic end products (e.g., free radicals, altered electrolytes, neurotransmitters), and release and recruitment of cellular mediators (e.g., cytokines) that disrupt normal parenchymal function.

Classification[edit]
Secondary brain tumors[edit]
Secondary tumors of the brain are metastatic and have invaded the brain from cancers originating in other organs. This means that a cancerous neoplasm has developed in another organ elsewhere in the body and that cancer cells have leaked from that primary tumor and then entered the lymphatic system and blood vessels. They then circulate through the bloodstream, and are deposited in the brain. There, these cells continue growing and dividing, becoming another invasive neoplasm of the primary cancer's tissue. Secondary tumors of the brain are very common in the terminal phases of patients with an incurable metastasized cancer; the most common types of cancers that bring about secondary tumors of the brain are lung cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, kidney cancer, and colon cancer (in decreasing order of frequency).

Secondary brain tumors are more common than primary ones; in the United States there are about 170,000 new cases every year. Secondary brain tumors are the most common cause of tumors in the intracranial cavity. The skull bone structure can also be subject to a neoplasm that by its very nature reduces the volume of the intracranial cavity, and can damage the brain.[14]

By behavior[edit]
Brain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). However, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differs from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body. In cancers elsewhere in the body, three malignant properties differentiate benign tumors from malignant forms of cancer: benign tumors are self-limited and do not invade or metastasize. Characteristics of malignant tumors include:

uncontrolled mitosis (growth by division beyond the normal limits)
anaplasia: the cells in the neoplasm have an obviously different form (in size and shape). Anaplastic cells display marked pleomorphism. The cell nuclei are characteristically extremely hyperchromatic (darkly stained) and enlarged; the nucleus might have the same size as the cytoplasm of the cell (nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio may approach 1:1, instead of the normal 1:4 or 1:6 ratio). Giant cells – considerably larger than their neighbors – may form and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei (syncytia). Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape.
invasion or infiltration (medical literature uses these terms as synonymous equivalents. However, for clarity, the articles that follow adhere to a convention that they mean slightly different things; this convention is not followed outside these articles):
Invasion or invasiveness is the spatial expansion of the tumor through uncontrolled mitosis, in the sense that the neoplasm invades the space occupied by adjacent tissue, thereby pushing the other tissue aside and eventually compressing the tissue. Often these tumors are associated with clearly outlined tumors in imaging.
Infiltration is the behavior of the tumor either to grow (microscopic) tentacles that push into the surrounding tissue (often making the outline of the tumor undefined or diffuse) or to have tumor cells "seeded" into the tissue beyond the circumference of the tumorous mass; this does not mean that an infiltrative tumor does not take up space or does not compress the surrounding tissue as it grows, but an infiltrating neoplasm makes it difficult to say where the tumor ends and the healthy tissue starts.
metastasis (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood).
Of the above malignant characteristics, some elements do not apply to primary neoplasms of the brain:

Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize to other organs; some forms of primary brain tumors can metastasize but will not spread outside the intracranial cavity or the central spinal canal. Due to the BBB, cancerous cells of a primary neoplasm cannot enter the bloodstream and get carried to another location in the body. (Occasional isolated case reports suggest spread of certain brain tumors outside the central nervous system, e.g. bone metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme.[15])
Primary brain tumors generally are invasive (i.e. they will expand spatially and intrude into the space occupied by other brain tissue and compress those brain tissues); however, some of the more malignant primary brain tumors will infiltrate the surrounding tissue.
Of numerous grading systems in use for the classification of tumor of the central nervous system, the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system is commonly used for astrocytoma. Established in 1993 in an effort to eliminate confusion regarding diagnoses, the WHO system established a four-tiered histologic grading guideline for astrocytomas that assigns a grade from 1 to 4, with 1 being the least aggressive and 4 being the most aggressive.

Types[edit]
Tumors can be benign or malignant, can occur in different parts of the brain, and may be primary or secondary. A primary tumor is one that has started in the brain, as opposed to a metastatic tumor, which is something that has spread to the brain from another part of the body.[16] The incidence of metastatic tumors are more prevalent than primary tumors by 4:1.[17] Tumors may or may not be symptomatic: some tumors are discovered because the patient has symptoms, others show up incidentally on an imaging scan, or at an autopsy.

The most common primary brain tumors are:[18]

Gliomas (50.4%)
Meningiomas (20.8%)
Pituitary adenomas (15%)
Nerve sheath tumors (8%)
These common tumors can also be organized according to tissue of origin as shown below:[19][verification needed]

Treatment[edit]
When a brain tumor is diagnosed, a medical team will be formed to assess the treatment options presented by the leading surgeon to the patient and his/her family. Given the location of primary solid neoplasms of the brain in most cases a "do-nothing" option is usually not presented. Neurosurgeons take the time to observe the evolution of the neoplasm before proposing a management plan to the patient and his/her relatives. These various types of treatment are available depending on neoplasm type and location and may be combined to give the best chances of survival:

Surgery: complete or partial resection of the tumor with the objective of removing as many tumor cells as possible.
Radiotherapy: the most commonly used treatment for brain tumors; the tumor is irradiated with beta, x rays or gamma rays.
Chemotherapy: is a treatment option for cancer, however it is not always used to treat brain tumors as the blood-brain barrier can prevent some drugs from reaching the cancerous cells.
A variety of experimental therapies are available through clinical trials.
Survival rates in primary brain tumors depend on the type of tumor, age, functional status of the patient, the extent of surgical tumor removal and other factors specific to each case.[20]

Surgery[edit]
The primary and most desired course of action described in medical literature is surgical removal (resection) via craniotomy. Minimally invasive techniques are becoming the dominant trend in neurosurgical oncology.[21] The prime remediating objective of surgery is to remove as many tumor cells as possible, with complete removal being the best outcome and cytoreduction ("debulking") of the tumor otherwise. In some cases access to the tumor is impossible and impedes or prohibits surgery.

Many meningiomas, with the exception of some tumors located at the skull base, can be successfully removed surgically. Most pituitary adenomas can be removed surgically, often using a minimally invasive approach through the nasal cavity and skull base (trans-nasal, trans-sphenoidal approach). Large pituitary adenomas require a craniotomy (opening of the skull) for their removal. Radiotherapy, including stereotactic approaches, is reserved for inoperable cases.

Several current research studies aim to improve the surgical removal of brain tumors by labeling tumor cells with 5-aminolevulinic acid that causes them to fluoresce.[22] Postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are integral parts of the therapeutic standard for malignant tumors. Radiotherapy may also be administered in cases of "low-grade" gliomas, when a significant tumor burden reduction could not be achieved surgically.

Any person undergoing brain surgery may suffer from epileptic seizures. These can take the form of either absence seizures or tonic-clonic seizures. Medication can lessen and sometimes prevent these attacks.

Multiple metastatic tumors are generally treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy rather than surgery and the prognosis in such cases is determined by the primary tumor, and is generally poor.

Radiation therapy[edit]
The goal of radiation therapy is to kill tumor cells while leaving normal brain tissue unharmed. In standard external beam radiation therapy, multiple treatments of standard-dose "fractions" of radiation are applied to the brain. This process is repeated for a total of 10 to 30 treatments, depending on the type of tumor. This additional treatment provides some patients with improved outcomes and longer survival rates.

Radiosurgery is a treatment method that uses computerized calculations to focus radiation at the site of the tumor while minimizing the radiation dose to the surrounding brain. Radiosurgery may be an adjunct to other treatments, or it may represent the primary treatment technique for some tumors. Forms used include stereotactic radiosurgery, such as Gamma knife, Cyberknife or Novalis Tx radiosurgery.[23][unreliable medical source?]

Radiotherapy may be used following, or in some cases in place of, resection of the tumor. Forms of radiotherapy used for brain cancer include external beam radiation therapy, the most common, and brachytherapy and proton therapy, the last especially used for children.

Radiotherapy is the most common treatment for secondary brain tumors. The amount of radiotherapy depends on the size of the area of the brain affected by cancer. Conventional external beam "whole-brain radiotherapy treatment" (WBRT) or "whole-brain irradiation" may be suggested if there is a risk that other secondary tumors will develop in the future.[24] Stereotactic radiotherapy is usually recommended in cases involving fewer than three small secondary brain tumors.

People who receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for the treatment of metastatic brain tumors have more than twice the risk of developing learning and memory problems than those treated with SRS alone.[25][26]

Chemotherapy[edit]
Patients undergoing chemotherapy are administered drugs designed to kill tumor cells. Although chemotherapy may improve overall survival in patients with the most malignant primary brain tumors, it does so in only about 20 percent of patients. Chemotherapy is often used in young children instead of radiation, as radiation may have negative effects on the developing brain. The decision to prescribe this treatment is based on a patient's overall health, type of tumor, and extent of the cancer. The toxicity and many side effects of the drugs, and the uncertain outcome of chemotherapy in brain tumors puts this treatment further down the line of treatment options with surgery and radiation therapy preferred.

UCLA Neuro-Oncology publishes real-time survival data for patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. They are the only institution in the United States that displays how brain tumor patients are performing on current therapies. They also show a listing of chemotherapy agents used to treat high-grade glioma tumors.[27]

Other[edit]
A shunt may be used to relieve symptoms caused by intracranial pressure, by reducing the build-up of fluid (hydrocephalus) caused by the blockage of the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid.[28]

Prognosis[edit]
The prognosis of brain cancer depends on the type of cancer diagnosed. Medulloblastoma has a good prognosis with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical resection while glioblastoma multiforme has a median survival of only 12 months even with aggressive chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Brainstem gliomas have the poorest prognosis of any form of brain cancer, with most patients dying within one year, even with therapy that typically consists of radiation to the tumor along with corticosteroids. However, one type, focal brainstem gliomas in children, seems open to exceptional prognosis and long-term survival has frequently been reported.[29]

Glioblastoma multiforme[edit]
Main article: Glioblastoma multiforme
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive (grade IV) and most common form of a malignant brain tumor. Even when aggressive multimodality therapy consisting of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgical excision is used, median survival is only 12–17 months. Standard therapy for glioblastoma multiforme consists of maximal surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy between two and four weeks after the surgical procedure to remove the cancer, then by chemotherapy. Most patients with glioblastoma take a corticosteroid, typically dexamethasone, during their illness to relieve symptoms. Experimental treatments include gamma knife radiosurgery,[30] boron neutron capture therapy and gene therapy.[31][32]

Oligodendrogliomas[edit]
Main article: Oligodendroglioma
Oligodendrogliomas are incurable but slowly progressive malignant brain tumors. They can be treated with surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination. For some suspected low-grade (grade II) tumors, only a course of watchful waiting and symptomatic therapy is opted for. These tumors show a high frequency of co-deletions of the p and q arms of chromosome 1 and chromosome 19 respectively (1p19q co-deletion) and have been found to be especially chemosensitive with one report claiming them to be one of the most chemosensitive tumors.[33] A median survival of up to 16.7 years has been reported for grade II oligodendrogliomas.[34]

Epidemiology[edit]
Figures for incidences of cancers of the brain show a significant difference between more- and less-developed countries (the less-developed countries have lower incidences of tumors of the brain),[35]— this could be explained by undiagnosed tumor-related deaths (patients in extreme poor situations do not get diagnosed, simply because they do not have access to the modern diagnostic facilities required to diagnose a brain tumor) and by deaths caused by other poverty-related causes that preempt a patient's life before tumors develop or tumors become life-threatening. Nevertheless, studies[which?] suggest that certain forms of primary brain tumors are more prevalent among certain groups of the population.

The incidence of low-grade astrocytoma has not been shown to vary significantly with nationality. However, studies examining the incidence of malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors have shown some variation with national origin. Since some high-grade lesions arise from low-grade tumors, these trends are worth mentioning. Specifically, the incidence of CNS tumors in the United States, Israel, and the Nordic countries is relatively high, while Japan and Asian countries have a lower incidence. These differences probably reflect some biological differences as well as differences in pathologic diagnosis and reporting.[36] Worldwide data on incidence of cancer can be found at the WHO (World Health Organisation) and is handled by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) located in France.[37]

United States[edit]
For the United States in the year 2005, it was projected that there would be 43,800 new cases of brain tumors [38][39] which accounted for less than 1 percent of all cancers, 2.4 percent of all cancer deaths,[40] and 20–25 percent of pediatric cancers.[40][41] Ultimately, it is estimated there are 13,000 deaths per year in the United States alone as a result of brain tumors.[39]

UK[edit]
Brain, other CNS or intracranial tumors are the ninth most common cancer in the UK (around 10,600 people were diagnosed in 2013), and it is the eighth most common cause of cancer death (around 5,200 people died in 2012).[42]

Research[edit]
Immunotherapy[edit]
Cancer immunotherapy is being actively studied. For malignant gliomas no therapy has been shown to improve life expectancy as of 2015.[43]

Vesicular stomatitis virus[edit]
See also: Oncolytic virus
In 2000, researchers used the vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV, to infect and kill cancer cells without affecting healthy cells.[44][45]

The initial discovery of the virus' oncolytic properties were limited to only a few types of cancer. Several independent studies have identified many more types susceptible to the virus, including glioblastoma multiforme cancer cells, which account for the majority of brain tumors.

In 2008, researchers artificially engineered strains of VSV that were less cytotoxic to normal cells. This advance allows administration of the virus without coadministration with interferon. Consequently, administration of the virus can be given intravenously or through the olfactory nerve. In the research, a human brain tumor was implanted into mice brains.

Research on virus treatment like this has been conducted for some years, but no other viruses have been shown to be as efficient or specific as the VSV mutant strains.

Retroviral replicating vectors[edit]

Led by Prof. Nori Kasahara, researchers from USC, who are now at UCLA, reported in 2001 the first successful example of applying the use of retroviral replicating vectors towards transducing cell lines derived from solid tumors.[46] Building on this initial work, the researchers applied the technology to in vivo models of cancer and in 2005 reported a long-term survival benefit in an experimental brain tumor animal model.[47][unreliable medical source?] Subsequently, in preparation for human clinical trials, this technology was further developed by Tocagen (a pharmaceutical company primarily focused on brain cancer treatments) as a combination treatment (Toca 511 & Toca FC). This has been under investigation since 2010 in a Phase I/II clinical trial for the potential treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma. No results have yet been published.[48]

Last update: PMID 23436013 (July 2014)
In the USA, about 2,000 children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age are diagnosed with malignant brain tumors each year. Higher incidence rates were reported in 1985–1994 than in 1975–1983. There is some debate as to the reasons; one theory is that the trend is the result of improved diagnosis and reporting, since the jump occurred at the same time that MRIs became available widely, and there was no coincident jump in mortality. The central nervous system cancer survival rate in children is approximately 60%. The rate varies with the type of cancer and the age of onset: younger patients have higher mortality.[49]

In children under 2, about 70% of brain tumors are medulloblastomas, ependymomas, and low-grade gliomas. Less commonly, and seen usually in infants, are teratomas and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors.[50] Germ cell tumors, including teratomas, make up just 3% of pediatric primary brain tumors, but the worldwide incidence varies significantly.[51]

In the UK, 429 children aged 14 and under are diagnosed with a brain tumour on average each year, and 563 children and young people under the age of 19 are diagnosed.
What is brain cancer?

Primary brain cancer develops from cells within the brain. Part of the central nervous system (CNS), the brain is the control center for vital functions of the body, including speech, movement, thoughts, feelings, memory, vision, hearing and more.

Primary brain tumors are classified by the type of cell or tissue the tumor affects, and the location and grade of the tumor. Tumor cells may travel short distances within the brain, but generally won't travel outside of the brain itself.

When cancer develops elsewhere in the body and spreads (metastasizes) to the brain, it’s called a secondary brain tumor, or metastatic brain cancer. Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors. Some cancers that commonly spread to the brain include lung, colon, kidney and breast cancers.
Brain cancer incidence

Each year, over 190,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a brain tumor (National Brain Tumor Society).

It is estimated that 23,770 new cases of brain and other nervous system cancers will be diagnosed in 2016, with the median age at the time of diagnosis being 58 (National Cancer Institute).
How brain cancer develops

The brain and spinal cord together make up the central nervous system (CNS). Cancer can begin in the CNS or, more commonly, it can spread there.

Primary brain tumors are tumors that form from cells within the brain. Not all primary brain tumors are the same. Primary brain tumors can be divided into malignant or benign tumors.

Benign primary brain tumors are not cancerous. They grow slowly, and tend to be more amendable to surgical or other treatments. However, benign brain tumors can still damage normal brain tissue and cause serious problems.
Malignant brain tumors are more aggressive by definition. They grow more quickly and invade local structures more aggressively.
Metastatic brain tumors are tumors that spread (metastasize) to the brain from another location in the body, such as the lung, colon, breast or kidney. Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors.

This booklet is designed to help you understand more about brain
and spinal cord tumours. It includes information about both noncancerous
(benign) and cancerous (malignant) tumours. Many
people feel shocked and upset when told they have a brain tumour.
We hope this booklet will help you, your family and friends
understand how brain and spinal cord tumours are diagnosed and
treated. We also include information about support services.
We cannot give advice about the best treatment for you. You need to
discuss this with your doctors. However, we hope this information
will answer some of your questions and help you think about
questions you may want to ask your treatment team.
This booklet does not need to be read from cover to cover – just
read the parts that are useful to you. Some medical terms that may
be unfamiliar are explained in the glossary. You may also like to pass
this booklet on to your family and friends for their information.
How this booklet was developed
The information in this booklet was developed with help from a

A tumour forms when cells don’t grow, divide and die in the
usual way. A tumour can be benign or malignant. A benign
tumour is non-cancerous. A malignant tumour is cancer.
Benign tumour – Cells are confined to one area, grow slowly,
and are not able to spread to other parts of the body. Although a
benign tumour can cause problems, it is not cancer.
Malignant tumour – This is made up of cancerous cells, which
in some cases have the ability to spread by travelling through the
bloodstream or lymphatic system (lymph fluid). Most primary
tumours of the brain and spine do not spread beyond the central
nervous system.

Cancer is a disease of the cells, which are the body’s basic building
blocks. The body constantly makes new cells to help us grow,
replace worn-out tissue and heal injuries. Normally, cells multiply
and die in an orderly way. The cancer that first develops in a tissue
or organ is called the primary cancer. A malignant tumour is
usually named after the organ or type of cell affected.
If cancerous cells grow and form another tumour at a new site,
it is called a secondary cancer or metastasis. A metastasis keeps
the name of the original cancer. For example, lung cancer that
has spread to the brain is still called metastatic lung cancer, even
though the person may be experiencing symptoms caused by
problems in the brain.
What is a tumour? 5
The brain and spinal cord
The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system
(CNS). The CNS receives messages from cells called nerves,
which are spread throughout the body.
The brain interprets information and relays messages through
the nerves to muscles and organs. The main sections of the
brain are the cerebrum (the largest part of the brain), the
cerebellum and the brain stem.
Deep within the brain is the pituitary gland. It controls growth
and development by releasing chemical messengers (hormones)
into the blood. These chemical messengers signal other
hormones to start or stop working.
The spinal cord extends from the brain stem to the lower back.
It consists of nerve cells and nerve bundles that connect the brain
to all parts of the body through the peripheral nervous system.
The spinal cord lies in the spinal canal, and is protected by bony
vertebrae (spinal column). Both the brain and spinal cord are
surrounded by membranes, which is called meninges. Inside
the skull and vertebrae, the brain and spinal cord float in liquid.
This liquid is called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Nervous tissue
The brain, spinal cord and nerves consist of billions of nerve
cells called neurons or neural cells, which process and send
information. Together, this is called nervous tissue.

The brain and spinal cord
The brain and spinal cord 7
The three main types of neural cells are:
• sensory neurons – respond to light, sound and touch
• motor neurons – cause muscle contractions
• interneurons – connect neurons in the brain and spinal cord.
Glial cells, or neuroglia, are the other main type of cells in the
nervous system. There are several different types of glial cells,
including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Glial cells surround the
neurons and hold them in place. The glial cells also supply nutrients
to neurons and clear away dead neurons and germs.
Brain function
The brain plays a unique role in the body’s essential functions.
The brain controls all voluntary and involuntary processes, such
as moving, learning, sensing, imagining, remembering, breathing,
blood circulation and heart rate, body temperature, digestion, and
bowel and bladder control (continence).
The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. The cerebrum is
divided into right and left hemispheres. The right hemisphere
controls muscles on the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere
controls muscles on the right side. The hemispheres are connected
by a band of nerve fibres known as the corpus callosum, which
transfers information between the two hemispheres.
Each hemisphere is divided into four main areas, called lobes,
which control different functions, as shown in the diagram on the
opposite page.
8 Cancer Council
The brain
Frontal lobe
Responsible for cognition, executive thinking and
memory, including your ability to concentrate, plan,
solve problems and some aspects of personality and
character. Also responsible for motor function, or
body movement. Your ability to change thoughts into
words is also stored here.
Brain stem
Controls life-supporting
functions including
alertness, arousal, breathing,
temperature, blood pressure
and ability to sleep.
Cerebellum
 Responsible for coordination
and timing of voluntary
movement, as well as balance,
standing and walking.
Regulates fear, pleasure,
attention and language.
Temporal lobe
Responsible for auditory
perception and language,
including recognition of words.
Contains the hippocampus,
where long-term memories are
formed.
Occipital lobe
Responsible for
visual processing,
including visual
memory.
Parietal lobe
Responsible for spatial
awareness, and integrating
senses including speech, visual
perception and touch.
The brain and spinal cord 9
Q: What is a brain or spinal cord tumour?
A: A brain or spinal cord tumour occurs when cells in the
central nervous system grow and divide to form a lump.
Tumours can be benign or malignant.
Benign (non-cancerous) tumours – Benign tumours
usually have slow-growing cells and rarely spread. However,
they may press on the brain, spinal cord, or the cranial
nerves, and cause symptoms. Benign tumours may be found
in areas of the brain that control vital life functions, and
require urgent treatment (see pages 29 – 42).
Malignant (cancerous) tumours – These life-threatening
tumours often grow rapidly, and may spread within the brain
and spinal cord, or reoccur even after treatment. Just over
40% of all brain and spinal cord tumours are malignant.1
Key questions
Childhood brain tumours
In Australia, about 130 children
under 15 are diagnosed with
a brain tumour each year.
Around 80% of these are
cancerous. Children are more
likely to develop tumours
in the lower parts of the
brain, the area that controls
movement and coordination.
Glioma and medulloblastoma
are the most common
types. About 20 children are
diagnosed with a spinal cord
tumour each year. If your child
has a brain tumour, you may
find the chapter Caring for a
child with a tumour helpful –
see page 58.
10 Cancer Council
Q: What types are there?
A: There are more than 100 types of brain and spinal cord
tumours (also called central nervous system or CNS tumours).
They are usually named after the cell type they started in.
Benign tumours – The most common types are
pituitary tumours (which grow from the pituitary gland),
meningiomas (which grow from the meninges), neuromas
(which grow from the nerves), and pilocytic astrocytomas.
Malignant tumours – The most common type of cancerous
brain tumours in adults and children are called gliomas. There
are three types of gliomas: astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas
and ependymons. Gliomas can be classified as low or high
grade depending on how fast they are growing. A common
high grade glioma is glioblastoma (also known as glioblastoma
multiforme or GBM), a type of astrocytoma. Medulloblastomas
are another type of malignant tumour, which develop in the
cerebellum. These are rare in adults but common in children.
Metastatic brain tumours – Secondary brain tumours that
begin as a primary cancer in another part of the body before
spreading to the brain. Cancers that may spread to the brain
include melanoma, bowel, breast, kidney and lung cancer.
Not all tumours are easily classified as benign or malignant. Some
types of tumours, such as gliomas and ependymomas, may be either.
Key questions 11
Q: How common are they?
A: Every year about 1700 malignant brain tumours are diagnosed
in Australia.2
 The most common type in adults is a type
of glioma called glioblastoma multiforme or GBM. These
tumours are generally found in the cerebral hemispheres.
Malignant spinal cord tumours are rare. About 80 people
are diagnosed with malignant spinal cord or central nervous
system tumours each year.
Data about benign brain and spinal cord tumours is not
collected, but they are more common than malignant
tumours.3
 In Australia, an estimated 2350 people – including
children – are diagnosed with a benign tumour each year.1
Electromagnetic radiation and brain cancer
Many people are concerned
that mobile phones or
microwave ovens may cause
brain cancer.
Evidence to date does not
show that mobile phone use
causes cancer. However, if you
are concerned about potential
harm from mobile phones,
you may choose to use a
headset, limit the time you
spend on your mobile phone
or consider texting rather than
calling. Additionally, you could
consider limiting your child’s
mobile phone use.
Microwave ovens have been
in widespread use since the
1980s. There is no evidence
that ovens in working order
emit electromagnetic radiation
at levels harmful to humans.
12 Cancer Council
Q: What are the symptoms?
A: Brain tumour symptoms depend on where it is located and
whether it is causing pressure in the skull or on the brain
or spinal cord. Sometimes, when a tumour grows slowly,
symptoms develop gradually, so you may not be aware of its
presence at first.
General symptoms of brain or spinal cord tumours include
headaches, seizures, changes in personality, or changes in
balance. Increased pressure in the skull can result in nausea,
vomiting and confusion. Tumours may also cause weakness
or paralysis in parts of the body. Other symptoms might
include memory loss, vision loss, hearing difficulties or
speech changes. Symptoms may differ depending on where
in the brain or spinal cord the tumour is located - see the
table on the following pages.
Many symptoms of brain tumours, such as a headache, are
more likely to be caused by other factors. However, new or
worsening symptoms should be reported to your doctor.
 My doctor thought I had depression but I insisted on
a CT scan as I had persistent headaches, felt disorientated
and couldn’t think clearly. The scan showed that I had a
brain tumour. Richard

Key questions 15
Q: What are the risk factors?
A: The causes of most brain and spinal cord tumours are
unknown. However, there are a few known risk factors for
malignant brain tumours:
• Family history – It is possible to have a genetic
predisposition to developing a tumour. This means that
you may have a fault in your genes, usually passed down
from one of your parents, that increases your risk. For
example, some people have a genetic condition called
neurofibromatosis, which causes nerve tissue tumours.
• Radiotherapy – People who have had radiation to the
head, usually to treat another type of cancer, may be at
an increased risk of developing a tumour. This may affect
people who had radiotherapy for childhood leukaemia.
Hydrocephalus
A brain tumour can sometimes block the flow of cerebrospinal
fluid around the brain and its spaces (cavities). When this
happens, fluid can build up and put pressure on the brain. This is
called hydrocephalus. The condition is most common in infants,
but it can occur in some adults. It is usually treated with a shunt.
16 Cancer Council
Diagnosis
Many people diagnosed with a brain or spinal cord tumour first
consult their general practitioner (GP) because they are feeling
unwell. Occasionally a brain tumour will be diagnosed during
a scan for something unrelated, such as a head injury. Some
people have sudden symptoms (such as loss of consciousness,
a severe headache or a seizure) and go directly to the hospital’s
emergency department.
The doctor will take your medical history and ask about your
symptoms. After that, you will have a physical examination. You
may then be referred to have one or more scans/tests to confirm
a diagnosis of a brain or spinal cord tumour.
Children have the same types of diagnostic tests as adults,
however young children may require a general anaesthetic for
some of the tests.
Physical examination
Your doctor will assess your nervous system to check how
different parts of your brain and body are working, including
your speech, hearing, vision and movement.
This is called a neurological examination and may cover:
• checking your reflexes (e.g. knee jerks)
• testing the strength in your limb muscles
• walking, to show your balance and coordination
• testing sensations (e.g. your ability to feel pinpricks)
• brain exercises, such as simple arithmetic or memory tests.
Diagnosis 17
The doctor may also test eye and pupil movements, and may look
into your eyes using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope.
This allows the doctor to see your optic nerve, which sends visual
information from the eyes to the brain. Swelling of the optic nerve
can be an early sign of raised pressure in the skull.
CT scan
A CT (computerised tomography) scan is a procedure that uses x-ray
beams to take pictures of the inside of your body. Unlike a standard
x-ray, which takes a single picture, a CT scan uses a computer to
compile many cross-sectional pictures of areas of your body.
A contrast dye may be injected into your veins. This injection will
help make the scan pictures clearer. It may make you feel flushed
and hot for a few minutes. Rarely, more serious reactions occur,
such as breathing difficulties or low blood pressure.
You will be asked to lie still on a table while the CT scanner, which
is large and round like a doughnut, slowly rotates around you. It
may take about 30 minutes to prepare for the scan, but the actual
test is painless and takes less than 10 minutes. You will be able to
go home when the scan is complete.
The dye that is injected into your veins before a CT or MRI scan
may contain iodine, and may affect your kidneys. Before your scan,
tell your doctor if you have any allergies. You may need to have
blood tests to check your kidney function.
18 Cancer Council
MRI scan
An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses magnetic waves
to create detailed cross-sectional pictures of organs in your brain
and spine. You should let your medical team know if you have a
pacemaker or another iron-based metallic object in your body,
because the scan may damage these devices.
For an MRI, you may be injected with a dye that highlights the
organs in your body. You will then lie on an examination table
inside a large metal tube that is open at both ends.
The test is painless, but the noise of the machine can be a source
of distress. In addition, some people feel anxious or claustrophobic
lying in such a confined space.
If you think you may become distressed, mention it beforehand to
your medical team. You may be given medicine to help you relax
or you might be able to bring someone into the room with you for
support. You will usually be offered headphones or earplugs.
The MRI scan takes 30–90 minutes and you will be able to go
home afterwards.
 I found the MRI confronting, going into the cylinder head
first and having to hold my breath. But now when I have this
scan during check-ups, I count to myself. This helps me feel
more in control. Robyn
Diagnosis 19
Further tests
You may also have some of the tests below, which show how quickly
or aggressively a tumour is growing (the grade) – see page 21. If
your doctor suggests any of these tests, you can ask for a more
detailed explanation of the procedures and any follow-up care.
MRS scan – An MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) scan can
be done at the same time as a standard MRI. It detects the chemical
make-up of the brain, which may be changed by a brain tumour.
MR tractography – An advanced imaging technique that may
enable visualisation of the message pathways (tracts) within
the brain e.g. the visual pathway (tracts). This can be useful in
planning treatment for gliomas.
MR perfusion scan – Another advanced imaging technique
that shows the amount of blood flow to various parts of the brain.
This scan also be used to distinguish between active tumour and
treatment effects.
SPET or SPECT scan – A SPET or SPECT (single photon
emission computerised tomography) scan takes 3D pictures of
your body to assess blood flow in the brain. A small amount of
radioactive fluid is injected into your body, which is then scanned
with a gamma camera. A brain tumour may have higher blood
flow than the rest of the brain.
PET scan – In a PET (positron emission tomography) scan you
are injected with a radioactive tracer solution. This is absorbed
20 Cancer Council
by cancer cells at a faster rate than normal cells and highlights the
active cells.
Lumbar puncture – A needle is inserted into the spinal column
to collect cerebrospinal fluid to see if cancer cells or abnormal
substances, such as blood or proteins, are present. Also called a
spinal tap.
Surgical biopsy – If scans show an abnormality that looks like a
tumour, some or all of the tissue may be removed for examination
(biopsy). In some cases, the neurosurgeon makes a small opening
in the skull and inserts a needle to take a sample. In other cases, the
neurosurgeon removes a larger part of the skull to get to the tumour.
Grading brain and spinal cord
tumours
The grade describes the rate at which tumours grow and the
likeliness or ability to spread into nearby tissue. Most brain and
spinal cord tumours don’t spread in the body. However, your
medical team may need to do other tests to check if the cancer has
spread (e.g. CT or MRI scans, or checking the cerebrospinal fluid).
Other tests to determine the type of tumour may also be used to
predict how a tumour will grow.
Brain and spinal cord tumours are usually given a grade on a scale
of 1 to 4. The grade is worked out by looking at the tumour cells
and comparing them to normal cells.
Diagnosis 21
Prognosis
Prognosis means the expected outcome of a disease. You may wish to
discuss your prognosis and treatment options with your doctor, but
it is not possible for any doctor to predict the exact course of your
disease.
There are many factors that may affect your prognosis. These include
tumour type, location of the tumour, grade, age, family history and
your general health.
Both benign and malignant tumours can be life-threatening, but you
may have a better prognosis if the tumour is benign or low-grade, or
if a surgeon is able to remove the entire tumour.
Some brain or spinal cord tumours, particularly gliomas, can come
back (recur). In this case, treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy or
Grading
Grades 1 and 2 These are the slowest-growing tumours.
They are called low-grade tumours.
Grade 3 Tumours grow at a moderate rate. They
are called high-grade tumours.
Grade 4 These are the fastest-growing tumours.
They are also called high-grade tumours.
22 Cancer Council
chemotherapy may be used to control the growth of the tumour for
as long as possible, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life.
To determine your prognosis, your doctor will consider:
• test results
• the type of cancer you have
• the rate and depth of tumour growth
• how well you respond to treatment
• other factors such as age, fitness and medical history.
For information about the prognosis of children with brain or
spinal cord tumours, see page 10.
Which health professionals will I see?
If your GP or another doctor suspects you have a brain or spinal
cord tumour, they will arrange the first tests to assess your
symptoms. You will then be referred to a neurologist, neurooncologist
or a neurosurgeon, who will examine you and may
do more tests and advise you about your treatment options.
You will be cared for by a range of health professionals who
specialise in different aspects of your treatment. This is called a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). The MDT will probably include
some or all of the health professionals listed on the next page.

Key points
• Many people diagnosed
with a brain or spinal cord
tumour have symptoms
caused by the tumour, such
as dizziness, headaches or
difficulty walking.
• You will probably have many
tests to diagnose the disease.
• A physical examination
checks how different parts
of your brain are working.
• Imaging scans, such as CT
and MRI, allow the doctor to
see pictures of the inside of
the brain.
• Other scans assess the
chemical make-up of the
brain, blood flow in the brain,
and whether there are active
cancer cells in the central
nervous system.
• You may also need a blood
test to check hormone
levels, and a biopsy, which
removes some tissue
for examination under a
microscope.
• The tests help doctors
diagnose the type of brain
or spinal cord tumour you
have, as well as its grade
and if it has spread. The
grade shows how abnormal
the cells are and how quickly
the tumour is growing.
• Many people want to know
the likely outcome of their
disease (prognosis). You will
need to discuss this with
your doctor, as it depends
on many factors.
• You will see a range of
health professionals who
specialise in different areas
of your treatment. You will
usually be referred to a
neurologist, neurosurgeon
or neuro-oncologist.
Diagnosis 25
Sometimes it is difficult to decide on the type of treatment to have.
You may feel that everything is happening too fast. Check with
your doctor how soon your treatment should start, and take as
much time as you can before making a decision.
Understanding the disease, the available treatments and possible
side effects can help you weigh up the pros and cons of different
treatments and make a well-informed decision that’s based on
your personal values. You may also want to discuss the options
with your doctor, friends and family.
You have the right to accept or refuse any treatment offered. Some
people with more advanced cancer choose treatment even if it
only offers a small benefit for a short period of time. Others want
to make sure the benefits outweigh the side effects so that they
have the best possible quality of life.
Talking with doctors
When your doctor first tells you that you have cancer, you may
not remember the details about what you are told. Taking notes
or recording the discussion may help. Many people like to have
a family member or friend go with them to take part in the
discussion, take notes or simply listen.
If you are confused or want clarification, you can ask questions
– see page 63 for a list of suggested questions. If you have several
questions, you may want to talk to a nurse or ask the office
manager if it is possible to book a longer appointment.

26 Cancer Council
A second opinion
You may want to get a second opinion from another specialist to
confirm or clarify your doctor’s recommendations or reassure you
that you have explored all of your options. Specialists are used to
people doing this.
Your doctor can refer you to another specialist and send your
initial results to that person. You can get a second opinion even if
you have started treatment or still want to be treated by your first
doctor. You might decide you would prefer to be treated by the
doctor who provided the second opinion.
Taking part in a clinical trial
Your doctor or nurse may suggest you take part in a clinical trial.
Doctors run clinical trials to test new or modified treatments and
ways of diagnosing disease to see if they are better than current
methods. For example, if you join a randomised trial for a new
treatment, you will be chosen at random to receive either the best
existing treatment or the modified new treatment.
Over the years, trials have improved treatments and led to better
outcomes for people diagnosed with cancer.
 My husband’s doctor said the tumour was inoperable.
We decided to get a second opinion from another
neurosurgeon to see if they agreed. Judith

It may be helpful to talk to your specialist or clinical trials nurse,
or get a second opinion. If you decide to take part, you can
withdraw at any time. For more information, call Cancer Council

Children and clinical trials
When parents discover their
child is suffering a brain or
spinal cord tumour, they
usually want to explore all
treatment options. This may
include thinking about whether
to join a clinical trial. For some
parents the decision is easy.
Other parents may have mixed
feelings.
If you are unsure, discussing
the issue in depth with
your treatment team before
committing may help with any
concerns. Or you may wish to
call Cancer Council 13 11 20
if you need more information
or support when deciding
whether or not to join a trial.
Oncologists will quite often
prescribe a treatment that is
based on clinical trials even
if the child is not enrolled in
the trial. This is because, in
many instances, the treatment
protocol follows the best
known treatment for a specific
tumour at the time. It may be
worth considering that today’s
treatments would not exist
without research. Participating
in a study means your child
also contributes to the
improvement of treatments for
children affected by all types
of cancer.
28 Cancer Council
Treatment
The main treatments for brain or spinal cord tumours are surgery,
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. These treatments may be used
alone or in combination. Medication, such as steroids, or anticonvulsants
(anti-seizure medication), may also be given to reduce
symptoms. Treatment offered to children is similar to adults.
There also may be new and experimental treatments, or
improvements in existing treatments. These are given in clinical
trials – for more information, see page 27.
The aim of treatment is to remove the tumour, slow its growth, or
relieve symptoms by shrinking the tumour and swelling.
Your choice of treatment will depend on:
• the type, size, grade and location of the tumour
• your age, medical history and general state of health
• the types of symptoms you experience.
Surgery
Surgery in the central and peripheral nervous system is called
neurosurgery. In many cases, removing all or part of the tumour
may allow you to fully recover and return to leading an active
life. However, you may also have other treatments, including
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Some tumours can be removed by neurosurgery. This type of
operation is called a gross total resection. In other cases, the surgeon
may only be able to remove part of the tumour. This is called a
Treatment 29
partial resection or debulking. Partial removal may be because
the tumour is widespread, near major blood vessels, or cannot be
removed without damaging other important parts of the brain or
spinal cord. A partial resection may improve your symptoms by
reducing the pressure on your brain.
Sometimes a tumour cannot be removed because it is too close to
certain parts of the brain and would cause serious problems. This
is called an inoperable or unresectable tumour. Your doctor will
talk to you about other ways to try to ease the symptoms.
Preparing for surgery
The types of scans used for diagnosing the tumour (e.g. CT, MRI
or MRS scans) are often done again when planning surgery to
precisely pinpoint the location of the tumour. If a stereotactic
surgery is planned, these scans will be imported into a computer
and be used to guide the surgeon during the operation (see page
33). You may also have what is called a ‘functional MRI scan’
to help the doctors work out which areas of your brain control
speech and movement.
Identifying the brain’s sensitive areas can help the surgeon avoid
causing damage during the operation. Brain mapping is another
way to find these parts of the brain. A tiny electrode is placed on
the outside layer of the brain during the surgery and stimulated
with a low dose of electrical current. The night before or on the
day of surgery you may be sent for a stereotactic CT or MRI scan.
Stereotactic surgery may require the surgeon to use small markers
called fiducial markers. See page 33 for more information.
30 Cancer Council
Before surgery, talk to your doctor about any medicines you are
taking. Some medicines interfere with the anaesthetic used during
the operation, so you should temporarily stop taking them. You may
also be advised to stop smoking before surgery.
Surgery for a brain tumour
The surgeon will remove as much of the tumour as possible
without damaging healthy parts of your brain. Surgery may be
done as open surgery (a relatively large opening made in the skull)
or a stereotactic surgery (see page 33).
Biopsy – A small sample of tumour is removed using a needle and
examined under a microscope. A biopsy can also be done at the
same time as a craniotomy.
Craniotomy –The most common type of brain tumour operation.
You are given a general anaesthetic and some hair is shaved off
and you are given a general anaesthetic. The surgeon cuts through
the scalp and moves it aside, then removes a piece of skull above
the tumour. After the tumour is taken out, the bone and scalp are
put back. The surgeon uses small plates and screws to hold the
piece of skull in place.
Patients with a high grade glioma may be given a solution of Gliolan®
(5-ALA) prior to surgery. This makes the tumour glow red under
ultraviolet light. It ensures the surgeon is able to remove as much of
the tumour as possible, while avoiding normal brain matter.
Treatment 31
Awake craniotomy – This operation is used if the tumour is near
parts of the brain that control speech or movement. All or part
of this operation is done with the patient awake (conscious) but
relaxed, so they can speak, move and respond. This is not painful
because the brain itself does not feel pain, and local anaesthetic is
used to numb surrounding tissues. During the surgery, the surgeon
asks the patient to speak or move parts of the body, so they can
identify and avoid certain parts of the brain. An electrode is also
used to stimulate and identify the important areas of the brain.
Endoscopic transphenoidal surgery – A rarer type of surgery
used for tumours near the base of the brain (e.g. a pituitary gland
tumour). The surgeon puts a long tube (endoscope) into the
nose, then removes all or part of the tumour through the nostrils.
Recovery may be faster than a craniotomy. An Ear, Nose and
Throat surgeon (ENT) may assist with this type of surgery.
Craniectomy – This is similar to a craniotomy, except the piece of
skull removed is not replaced. Bone (or a piece of plastic or mesh)
may be replaced in the future when it won’t cause extra pressure.
This procedure is very uncommon.
 I had a craniotomy for a benign brain tumour but they
couldn’t take all the tumour out. The risk of paralysis or
a stroke was too high because the tumour was wrapped
around my carotid artery. Later I had radiotherapy. Part of the
tumour is still there, but it is stable, so I have been able to
return to full-time work and I can now drive again. Debbie
32 Cancer Council
Stereotactic surgery
This is when surgery is done
using a computer to guide
the surgeon. The computer
creates 3D images of the brain
and tumour and monitors the
surgical instruments during
the operation, allowing the
surgeon to operate precisely.
Stereotactic surgery may
require the surgeon to use
small markers called fiducial
markers. These are taped
or glued to the scalp before
a scan. Less commonly, a
lightweight frame is screwed to
the scalp. The scan shows the
brain and tumour in relation to
the markers or frame.
Stereotactic surgery is safer,
more accurate and requires
a smaller cut in the skull than
non-computer guided surgery.
Surgery for a spinal cord tumour
The most common surgery to access a spinal cord tumour is called
a laminectomy. In this procedure, the surgeon makes an opening
through the skin, muscle and a vertebra in the spinal column to
remove the tumour that is affecting the spinal cord. You will be
given a general anaesthetic for this operation.
After your brain or spinal cord operation
For the first 12–24 hours after the operation, you will be closely
monitored. Nurses will regularly check your breathing, pulse,
blood pressure, temperature, pupil size, arm and leg strength and
function, and you will be asked questions to assess your level of
consciousness. These neurological observations show how your
brain and body are recovering from surgery.
Treatment 33
Some people have a build-up of fluid in their brain. This is called
hydrocephalus. The surgeon may place a long, thin, permanent or
temporary tube called a shunt from your brain into your abdomen
to drain the extra fluid. The fluid can then be safely absorbed into
the bloodstream. A small valve is inserted just under the scalp to
make sure the fluid flows away from the brain. You may need to
wear pressure stockings on your legs to prevent blood clots from
forming while you are recovering from surgery. Tell your doctor or
nurse if you have pain or swelling in your legs or suddenly develop
difficulty breathing.
If you are recovering from a craniotomy, your head will be
bandaged. Your face and eyes may be swollen or bruised, but this is
not usually painful and should ease within about a week.
You may have a headache or nausea after the operation. Both can
be treated with medicines.
If you have had an operation on your spinal cord, the nurses will
regularly check the movement and sensation in your arms and legs.
You may need to lie flat in bed for 2–5 days to allow the wound to
heal. A physiotherapist will help you learn how to roll over and how
to get out of bed safely so the wound is not damaged. Your doctor
will tell you when you can start regular activities again.
Your length of stay in hospital will depend on whether you have any
problems or side effects following surgery. You may require a period
of rehabilitation before you can return home. For more information,
see page 44.
34 Cancer Council
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy (also called radiation therapy) is a type of
treatment that uses high-energy x-ray beams to kill or damage
cancer cells. The radiation is specifically targeted at the
treatment site to reduce the risk of damage to healthy cells. The
treatment itself is usually painless, though you may experience
side effects afterwards – see page 37 for more information.
Before your radiotherapy begins, you will need to have a
simulation or planning appointment to plan the treatment. A
radiation therapist will take measurements of your body, as
well as doing a CT scan, to work out the precise area to
be treated.
If you are receiving radiotherapy treatment for a spinal cord
tumour, some small tattoos may be marked on your skin to
indicate the treatment area. If you are having radiotherapy for
a brain tumour, a face mask is made before your CT session to
keep the head in position.
The face mask is made of a tight-fitting mesh, but you will only
wear it for about 10 minutes at a time. You can see and breathe
through the mask but it may feel strange and uncomfortable
at first. Your treating team can talk to you about techniques to
help you manage if you need them.
Radiotherapy treatment is usually given once daily, from
Monday to Friday, for several weeks. However, the course of
your treatment will depend on the size and type of the tumour.
Treatment 35
Stereotactic radiosurgery
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialised type of radiation
therapy, not a type of surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery is
sometimes called Gamma Knife® or CyberKnife® treatment, after
the machines used to give it.
It is a non-invasive treatment that uses high doses of precisely
targeted radiation to treat a brain tumour. Treatment is so
accurate that surrounding areas of healthy brain tissue are
unlikely to be affected.
A treatment session usually lasts between 15 minutes and two
hours, depending on the type of radiosurgery given. You will
usually be able to return home afterwards.
Radiosurgery may be offered when traditional surgery is not
suitable or as an alternative to open surgery. It is most commonly
used for some meningiomas and pituitary tumours, and acoustic
neuroma. It is also used for metastatic cancers that have spread
from another part of the body.
Stereotactic radiotherapy may also be used to deliver a long course
of radiation, particularly for benign brain tumours. The same
precise system is used, but several small treatments are given.
Radiosurgery is not usually used for gliomas, as they require a
larger treatment area.
36 Cancer Council
Side effects of radiotherapy
Radiotherapy side effects commonly occur in the treatment area
and are usually temporary, but some may be permanent or last for
a few months or years.
The side effects vary depending on if you have a brain or spinal
cord tumour. They may include:
• nausea – often occurs during the course of treatment
• headaches – often occur during the course of treatment
• tiredness or fatigue – worse at the end of treatment for a brain
or spinal cord tumour, and fades over time
• red, sore, inflamed or flaky skin – may occur in the
treatment area, usually happens at the end of treatment for brain
tumours, but can and may worsen before improving
• hair loss – may occur in the brain tumour treatment area
• swallowing problems (dysphagia) – may occur following
treatment for spinal cord tumours
• diarrhoea – may occur after radiotherapy for spinal cord
tumours.
Some people experience similar side effects for several years after
treatment. However, it is not always clear if these changes are
caused by radiotherapy, the tumour or other treatment. You may
benefit from rehabilition therapy (see page 44) or medication.
Your treatment team may also monitor the hormone levels in your
pituitary gland.
For more information on radiotherapy treatment, call Cancer
Council 13 11 20 for a free copy of Understanding Radiotherapy.
Treatment 37
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to treat cancer. Generally,
chemotherapy drugs travel through the bloodstream and damage
or destroy rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells, while causing
the least possible damage to healthy cells. Healthy fast-growing
cells, such as your bone marrow, may also be affected, causing side
effects (see the next page).
However, it can be difficult to treat brain tumours with
chemotherapy drugs because the body has a protection system
called the blood-brain barrier. This guards the brain from harmful
substances that may be circulating in the blood, such as germs or
chemicals. Only certain drugs can get through this barrier.
You may be given chemotherapy by taking an oral capsule or
through a drip inserted into your vein (intravenously). Each
treatment session is usually followed by a rest period of a few weeks.
Oral temozolomide is commonly used to treat gliomas because it
is generally effective and well tolerated. If the tumour progresses
or recurs while you are taking temozolomide, your onocologist
may consider changing the dose or switching to a different
chemotherapy drug or combination.
Chemotherapy is often combined with radiotherapy for the
treatment of glioblastomas (grade 4 tumours). This combination
improves outcomes, compared with radiotherapy alone.
38 Cancer Council
Side effects of chemotherapy
The way your body reacts to chemotherapy will be monitored
through regular blood tests. Your treatment schedule may change
when your doctor sees how you are responding to the drugs.
There are many possible side effects of chemotherapy, depending
on the type of drugs you are given. Side effects may include:
• increased risk of infection
• nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite
• tiredness, fatigue and lack of energy
• mouth sores and ulcers
• diarrhoea or constipation
• breathlessness due to low red blood cell levels (anaemia)
• the feeling of pins and needles (nerve damage known as
peripheral neuropathy).
Hair loss is rare with the drugs commonly used to treat brain and
spinal cord tumours.
For more information on chemotherapy call Cancer Council
13 11 20 for a free copy of Understanding Chemotherapy.
Steroids
Steroids are made naturally in the body, but they can also be
produced artificially and used as drugs. Steroids may help to
reduce swelling in the brain, and can be given before, during
and after surgery and radiotherapy. Dexamethasone is the most
commonly prescribed steroid. It is important to eat some food
Treatment 39
before taking steroids. This decreases the likelihood of the steroids
irritating your stomach.
The side effects you experience depend on the dose and the length
of treatment. If you are prescribed steroids for a short period,
you may experience increased appetite, weight gain, insomnia,
restlessness, mood swings, anxiety and very occasionally more
serious disturbances of thought and behaviour.
If taken for several months, steroids can cause puffy skin (fluid
retention or oedema) in the feet, hands or face; high blood pressure;
unstable blood sugar levels; diabetes; or muscle weakness and
osteoporosis. You will also be more likely to get infections.
Most side effects are temporary and will fade if your medical team
reduces your dose. Short-term side effects can be managed. An
experienced counsellor, psychologist or psychiatrist can help you
manage mood swings or behavioural changes. A physiotherapist
can assist with muscle weakness. If you or your family members are
worried about side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or a counsellor.
 Steroids cause severe mood swings for me. You could
tell me I won the lottery and I’d feel like I hated life. I get
irritated and cry easily. It’s not rational of course, but I’m
aware of how they make me feel and I wait out the feelings.

Palliative treatment
Palliative treatment helps to improve people’s quality of life by
alleviating symptoms of cancer without trying to cure the disease.
It is particularly important for people with advanced cancer.
However, it is not just for end-of-life care and it can be used at
different stages of cancer. Palliative care services can be accessed
in the home as well as in a hospital or residential care.
Often treatment is concerned with pain relief and stopping the
spread of cancer, but it also involves the management of other
physical and emotional symptoms, and psychosocial support for
patients and families.
Call Cancer Council 13 11 20 or visit your local Cancer Council
website for more information about palliative care and advanced
cancer, or to order the Understanding Palliative Care booklet.

Living with a brain
tumour
Many people experience changes in the way their body functions
as a result of a brain or spinal cord tumour, or treatment for
these tumours. You or your family members may notice changes
in your speech, personality, memory, movement, balance and
coordination. If you notice some differences in behaviour, talk to
your doctor, nurse or care coordinator.
Emotionally, these changes may be difficult to cope with. You
might find that your self esteem and your relationships, especially
with those close to you, are affected. Talking to a counsellor or
someone who has had a similar experience may help. Call Cancer
Council 13 11 20 to see what support is available close to you.
The brain can sometimes heal itself after treatment, but this can be
a slow process. Many patients require some rehabilitation to help
restore their abilities or manage changes. The type of therapy you
have depends on your needs, choices and what is available.
Children and brain tumours
School-aged children with
brain tumours may benefit
from tutoring as part of their
rehabilitation. This may be
available through children’s
charities such as Redkite

school if they have a copy
of Cancer Council’s
Cancer in the School
Community, or talk to the
student welfare coordinator,
school counsellor or the
principal. You can also
ask the medical team for
information about how the
tumour and treatment may
have affected your child.
Living with a brain tumour 43
Rehabilitation
Cognitive rehabilitation – If your memory, language skills or
concentration is affected, a neuropsychologist, speech pathologist or
occupational therapist may help you to improve your cognitive skills
using memory activities, diaries and language puzzles.
Physiotherapy – In some cases, physiotherapy can help you to learn
how to move more easily. It can also help you to develop, maintain or
regain strength and balance. Moving and strengthening your muscles
can help reduce tiredness. If you can’t move easily, you may be able
to learn compensation techniques, such as using a walking stick.
You may also be given advice on how to exercise safely and stimulate
parts of your body to improve circulation and reduce swelling.
Speech therapy – If your ability to talk has been affected, a speech
pathologist may be able to help. Speech pathologists also work with
people who have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).
Occupational therapy – Some people find their tumour or their
treatment impacts on their ability to perform everyday activities
(e.g. preparing a meal). Occupational therapy aims to help you to
return to the activities that are important to you. A range of physical
or cognitive strategies are used to manage fatigue and improve or
maintain your independence.
Assistance for vision impaired – Some people may lose some
or all of their sight as a result of a brain tumour or surgery. Vision

Managing seizures
If you are diagnosed with a brain tumour, you may experience
seizures, which are disruptions to the normal patterns of electrical
impulses in the brain.
Seizures are sometimes called fits or convulsions. They can often
be prevented with anti-convulsant medication (also called antiepileptic
or anti-seizure medication). You can minimise your
seizure risk by making sure you don’t get too tired or fatigued.
Generalised seizures – These types of seizures typically affect the
whole body. The most common type is called a tonic-clonic seizure
(previously known as a grand mal seizure). A seizure often starts
with a sudden cry, followed by the person falling down and losing
consciousness. The person’s muscles may twitch violently and their
breathing may be shallow for up to two minutes. They may lose
control of their bladder or bowel and bite their tongue.
Partial seizures – These affect one part of the body, such as an
arm or a leg. Symptoms include twitching; jerking; tingling or
numbness; altered sensations (hallucinations), such as changed
vision or hearing, sensing strange tastes or smells, or a feeling of
déjà vu. Partial seizures may cause a brief loss of consciousness.
Grapefruit, Seville oranges and certain herbal medicines may
change the way some anti-convulsants work. You should also limit
your alcohol intake.
Living with a brain tumour 45
Ways to help someone having a seizure
• Remain calm and stay with
the person while they are
having a seizure, but do not
restrain them or put anything
in their mouth.
• Protect the person from
injury (e.g. move hazards,
lower to floor if possible,
loosen clothing, place a soft
pillow under their head and
shoulders).
• Lie the person on their side
to clear their airway. This
is particularly important
if they have vomited, are
unconscious or have food
or fluid in their mouth.
• If help is needed, call an
ambulance (000).
• Observe the person until
they have recovered or the
ambulance arrives.
• Time how long the seizure
lasts so you can advise the
paramedics.
• Talk to the person and explain
what has occurred. In many
cases, people are confused
after a seizure.
• If the seizure occurs while a
person is in a wheelchair or
car, support their head and
leave them safely strapped
in their seat until the seizure
is over. Afterwards, remove
the person from their seat, if
possible. Roll them onto their
side if there is food, water or
vomit in their mouth.
• Allow the person to rest after
having a seizure as most
seizures are exhausting.
• For detailed information
about seizures, contact
Epilepsy Action Australia

46 Cancer Council
Anti-convulsant medicines
There are many types of anti-convulsant drugs, which are used to
prevent seizures. You may require blood tests while you are taking
anti-convulsants. This is to check whether the dose is effective and
how your liver is coping with the medicine.
Side effects of anti-convulsant drugs vary and may include
tiredness, weight changes, gum problems, tremors, nausea,
vomiting and depression. If you are allergic to the medicine,
you may get a rash. Tell your medical team if you have any skin
changes or other side effects.
Your doctor can adjust your dose to reduce any side effects, or can
give you another type to try. It is important not to stop taking the
medicine or change the dose without your doctor’s advice.
Driving
Benign and malignant tumours, seizures, and certain treatments
and medications (such as anti-convulsants and some pain-killers)
can cause changes in vision, mobility, coordination, perception
and judgment. These changes can affect a person’s driving skills.
If you are diagnosed with any type of brain tumour it is very
important to ask your doctor how your condition or treatment
will impact on your ability to drive. When you are first diagnosed
with a brain tumour your doctor may advise you not to drive for a
period of time. You may also be advised not to drive for a period
after surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Living with a brain tumour 47
Always check with your doctor before resuming driving.
Laws in Australia require drivers to report any permanent or long
term illness or injury that is likely to affect their ability to drive
to their driver licensing authority. Your doctor can advise you if
you should report your condition or if there are any temporary
restrictions. The licensing authority will request information from
your doctor to decide if you are medically fit to drive.
You may be referred to a neurologist to assess your fitness/
suitability to return to driving. This may include doing an
electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess your seizure risk. You
may also have an occupational therapy driving assessment. This
can determine the type of difficulties you are experiencing while
driving (for example, a slow reaction time).
The focus of a driving assessment is not to suspend or cancel your
licence. In some cases, an occupational therapist is able to teach
you driving techniques to address your weaknesses or instruct
you on how to use car modifications (such as additional mirrors).
You may also be able to drive with restrictions, such as only in
daylight, only in vehicles with automatic transmission, or only
short distances from home.
Some people feel upset or frustrated if they are no longer able
to drive or they have restrictions placed on their licence. These
reactions are natural and understandable.
Changes in your ability to drive can affect your sense of
independence and may impact on your family too. However, it
48 Cancer Council
may help to remember that the decision is made for your safety
and wellbeing. It is also made for the safety of passengers,
pedestrians and other road users who could be injured if your
driving is unsafe. If you have to stop driving, you may want to
talk to a counsellor or someone who has been through a similar
experience (see page 56). Depending on your situation and
your ongoing health, it may be possible to return to driving at
a later stage.
For more information, talk to your doctor or visit the Frequently
Asked Questions under ‘Assessing Fitness to Drive’ on the
Austroads website austroads.com.au.
The impact of licence changes
If your licence has restrictions but you ignore them or drive
unsafely, your licence may then be suspended or cancelled. If your
licence has been suspended or cancelled, but you keep driving,
you may be fined. In addition, if you have an accident whilst
driving, you could be charged with a criminal offence and your
insurance policy will no longer be valid.

Looking after yourself
Cancer can cause physical and emotional strain. It’s important to
try to look after your wellbeing as much as possible.
Nutrition – Eating healthy food can help you cope with treatment
and side effects. A dietitian can help you manage special dietary
needs or eating problems, and choose the best foods for your
situation. Call Cancer Council 13 11 20 for a free copy of the
Nutrition and Cancer booklet.
Staying active – Physical activity may help to reduce tiredness,
improve circulation and elevate mood. The amount and type of
exercise you do depends on what you are used to, how you feel,
and your doctor’s advice. Cancer Council’s Exercise for People
Living with Cancer booklet provides more information about the
benefits of exercise, and outlines simple exercises that you may
want to try.
Complementary therapies – These therapies are used with
conventional medical treatments. You may have therapies such
as massage, relaxation and acupuncture to increase your sense of
control, decrease stress and anxiety, and improve your mood. Let
your doctor know about any therapies you are using or thinking
about trying, as some may not be safe or evidence-based.
Alternative therapies are used instead of conventional medical
treatments. These therapies, such as coffee enemas and magnet
therapy, can be harmful. For more information, call 13 11 20 for a
free copy of the Understanding Complementary Therapies booklet
or visit your local Cancer Council website.
Looking after yourself 51
Relationships with others
Having cancer can affect your relationships with family, friends
and colleagues. This may be because cancer is stressful, tiring and
upsetting, or as a result of more positive changes to your values,
priorities, or outlook on life.
Give yourself time to adjust to what’s happening, and do the same
for others. People may deal with the cancer in different ways – for
example, by being overly positive, playing down fears, or keeping a
distance. It may be helpful to discuss your feelings with each other.
Sexuality, intimacy and fertility
Cancer can affect your sexuality in physical and emotional ways. The
impact of these changes depends on many factors, such as treatment
and side effects, your self-confidence, and if you have a partner.
Although sexual intercourse may not always be possible, closeness
and sharing can still be part of your relationship. If you are able to
have sex, you may be advised to use certain types of contraception
to protect your partner or avoid pregnancy for a certain period of
time. Your doctor will talk to you about the precautions to take. They
will also tell you if treatment will affect your fertility permanently
or temporarily. If having children is important to you, talk to your
doctor before starting treatment.
Call Cancer Council 13 11 20 for free copies of Sexuality, Intimacy
and Cancer and Fertility and Cancer, or download the booklets
from your local Cancer Council website.
52 Cancer Council
Life after treatment
For most people, the cancer experience doesn’t end on the last
day of treatment. Life after cancer treatment can present its own
challenges. You may have mixed feelings when treatment ends, and
worry if every ache and pain means the cancer is coming back.
Some people say that they feel pressure to return to ‘normal life’,
but they don’t want life to return to how it was before cancer. Take
some time to adjust to the physical and emotional changes, and reestablish
a new daily routine at your own pace.
Cancer Council 13 11 20 can help you connect with other people
who have had cancer, and provide you with information about the
emotional and practical aspects of living well after cancer.
Dealing with feelings of sadness
If you have continued feelings
of sadness, have trouble
getting up in the morning or
have lost motivation to do
things that previously gave
you pleasure, you may be
experiencing depression.
This is quite common among
people who have had cancer.
Talk to your GP, as counselling
or medication – even for a
short time – may help. Some
people are able to get a
Medicare rebate for sessions
with a psychologist. Ask your
doctor if you are eligible. Your
local Cancer Council may also
run a counselling program.
The organisation beyondblue
has information about coping
with depression and anxiety.
Go to beyondblue.org.au or
call 1300 224 636 to order a
fact sheet.
Looking after yourself 53
Follow-up after treatment
After your treatment, you will need regular check-ups – this may
include MRI scans, blood tests, scans and physical examinations.
Depending on the type of tumour you had, check-ups will often
become less frequent if you have no further problems and more
time passes since you were diagnosed.
What if the cancer returns?
For some people, a brain or spinal cord tumour does come back
or continues growing after treatment. If the tumour returns, this is
known as a recurrence. Your doctor will talk to you about your
treatment options. Some people choose to have further treatment;
others decide not to have any. Your subsequent treatment will
depend on your situation and the treatments you’ve already had.
 You do get nervous and you tell yourself it’s only a
check-up – but it becomes this mountain. I have my scans on
Monday and see the doctor on Wednesday, because I can’t
handle having to wait for the results any longer. Mark
54 Cancer Council
Seeking support
Cancer may cause you to experience a range of emotions, such
as fear, sadness, anxiety, anger or frustration. It can also cause
practical and financial problems.
Practical and financial help
There are many services that can help deal with practical or
financial problems caused by the cancer. Benefits, pensions and
programs can help pay for prescription medicines, transport costs
or utility bills. Home care services, aids and appliances can also be
arranged to help make life easier.
Ask the hospital social worker which services are available in your
local area and if you are eligible to receive them.
If you need legal or financial advice, you should talk to a qualified
professional about your situation. Cancer Council offers free legal
and financial services in some states and territories for people who
can’t afford to pay – call 13 11 20 to ask if you are eligible.
Talk to someone who’s been there
Coming into contact with other people who have had similar
experiences to you can be beneficial. You may feel supported
and relieved to know that others understand what you are going
through and that you are not alone.
People often feel they can speak openly and share tips with others
who have gone through a similar experience.
Seeking support 55
In a support setting, you may find that you are comfortable talking
about your diagnosis and treatment, relationships with friends and
family, and hopes and fears for the future. Some people say they
can be even more open and honest because they aren’t trying to
protect their loved ones.
Types of support
There are many ways to connect with others for mutual support
and to share information. This includes:
• face-to-face support groups – often held in community
centres or hospitals
• telephone support groups – facilitated by trained counsellors
• peer support programs – match you with someone who has
had a similar cancer experience, e.g. Cancer Connect
• online forums – such as cancerconnections.com.au.
Talk to your nurse, social worker or Cancer Council 13 11 20
about what is available in your area.
 My family members don’t really understand what it’s like
to have cancer thrown at you, but in my support group, I
don’t feel like I have to explain. Sam
56 Cancer Council
Caring for an adult
with a tumour
You may be reading this booklet because you are caring for
someone with a tumour. Being a carer can be stressful and cause
you much anxiety. Try to look after yourself – give yourself some
time out and share your worries and concerns with somebody
neutral such as a counsellor or your doctor.
Many cancer support groups and cancer education programs are
open to carers, as well as people with cancer. Support groups and
programs can offer valuable opportunities to share experiences
and ways of coping.
Support services such as Home Help, Meals on Wheels or visiting
nurses can help you in your caring role. There are also many
groups and organisations that can provide you with information
and support, such as Carers Australia, the national body
representing carers in Australia. Carers Australia works with the
Carers Associations in each of the states and territories. Phone
1800 242 636 or visit carersaustralia.com.au for more information
and resources.
You can also call Cancer Council 13 11 20 to find out more about
carers’ services and get a copy of the Caring for Someone with
Cancer booklet.
BrainLink may also have helpful services for carers of people with
brain diseases – visit the website brainlink.org.au.
Caring for an adult with a tumour 57
Caring for a child with
a tumour
Prognosis
The outcome for your child depends on the type of tumour they
have, its location and grade, treatment, and other factors such as
their overall health. A significant number of children with a brain
or spinal cord tumour will recover completely. In general, children
who are diagnosed with a malignant tumour will have a better
outlook than adults. Other children have treatment that controls
their tumour for many years.
Because a child’s nervous system is still developing, some children
may develop a physical, behavioural or learning disability as a result
of their tumour or treatment.
Talk to your child’s medical team about the treatment options, what
to expect, and any concerns you have. You may also benefit from
talking to a hospital social worker, who can provide practical and
emotional support to your family.
Try to keep things normal
One of your child’s most important needs will be for as many things
as possible to stay consistent. It is important to continue to show
your love and support. It may help to keep rules and discipline as
normal as possible. Although you may be tempted to relax the rules,
this can lead to confusion over time.
A tumour diagnosis can also be difficult for other children in the
family. Their routines may also be disturbed and they may feel left
out if parents and visitors show more attention to their sibling.
58 Cancer Council
Try to make time to talk to all your children – ask them how they’re
coping and thank them for their patience and help. If your teenager
has been diagnosed with a tumour, it can be hard not to be protective
at a time when they want to be independent. Talk about finding
a balance between maintaining regular activities, going out with
friends and staying at home.
Who can help?
Many hospital staff members specialise in working with children and
young adults (paediatrics). Some hospitals employ staff, such as play
therapists, music therapists or art therapists, who can help children
cope with the challenges of treatment. Rehabilitation will also be
important for your child’s recovery (see page 44). Organisations
like CanTeen and Redkite offer practical and emotional support for
families, young adults and children who are affected by cancer.
What should I tell my child?
It is natural to want to protect your child from the news of the
diagnosis, but children are quick to listen, observe and learn.
Doctor’s visits, tests, and absences from school or activities will let
them know that something is different. Talking openly about the
tumour will help your child to be less anxious and to feel more
in control. What you tell your child will depend on their age and
knowledge. See tables on the following pages.

your local Cancer Council website.
Caring for a child with a tumour 59
Newborns, infants and toddlers
Children this young do not
understand illness, but will
react to being separated
from you and changes
in routine. They may not
be able to talk about it,
but they often pick up on
physical and emotional
changes. Toddlers like to
have control over their
environment.
• Create a familiar environment
that can travel with the child,
such as their travel cot and
favourite blanket, books
and toys.
• Be honest about hospital trips
and explain tests that may hurt.
• Give your toddler choices where
possible. e.g. “Would you like
to wear the red or blue shirt to
hospital?”
• If they are in hospital for a period
of time, put up some family
photographs.
Preschool children, 3–5 years
Children in this age group
are beginning to understand
the difference between
being well and being sick.
They often believe their
actions can make things
happen.
• Assure your child that their
thoughts and behaviour have not
caused the illness.
• Be honest when talking about
the tests and treatments that
they need.
• Reassure your child about your
love and care for them.
• Bring familiar toys and books to
appointments and the hospital.
60 Cancer Council
School-age children, 6–12 years
By this age some children
know about cancer, but
may not know its causes.
They may fill in the gaps
with their own theories.
They can understand what
cancer cells are.
• Be open and truthful so they don’t
assume their own interpretations
are correct.
• Tell the school about your child’s
health and the reasons for any
changes in their behaviour or
attendance patterns.
• If necessary, seek the support of
the student welfare coordinator
who may be able to organise
extra tutoring or support.
Teenagers, 13–18 years
Many teenagers have an
adult understanding of
cancer and often want
detailed information. They
are starting to separate
from the family. This is a
vulnerable time, as they
don’t want to appear
different from their peers.
• Provide resources so they can
learn more about the diagnosis
and treatment of tumours, and
get valuable peer and adult
support.
• Talk to the school’s student
welfare coordinator, who may be
able to organise or provide extra
tutoring or support.
• Encourage teenagers to talk
about their feelings but realise
they may find it easier to confide
in friends, teachers and other
trusted people.

Question checklist
You may find this checklist helpful when thinking about the
questions you want to ask your doctor about your disease and
treatment. If your doctor gives you answers that you don’t
understand, ask for clarification.
• What type of brain or spinal cord tumour do I have? Is it benign
or malignant?
• How extensive is the tumour? What grade is it?
• What treatment do you recommend and why? Are there other
treatment choices for me? If not, why not?
• What are the risks and possible side effects of each treatment? Is
there anything I should watch out for?
• How long will treatment take? Will I have to stay in hospital?
• How much will treatment cost? How can the cost be reduced?
• Will I have a lot of pain with the treatment? What will be done
about this?
• Are the latest tests and treatments for this type of cancer
available in this hospital?
• Are there any clinical trials or research studies I could join?
• How frequently will I need check-ups after treatment? Who
should I go to for these appointments?
• Are there any complementary therapies that might help me?
• Should I change my diet during or after treatment?
• If the cancer comes back, how will I know?
